To maintain proper polarity when wiring a receptacle, connect the black hot wire to one of the hot bronze-colored terminals. Add a few feet for each fixture so you have some slack and the ability to relocate the fixtures slightly.</p>
<p>IN choosing these devices, one must remember not to confuse a surge protection strip with an ordinary power strip. These whole house generators are designed to run for longer times using either liquid propane or natural gas.
