A whole-house surge protector is a device installed to protect all the appliances in your home from any electrical spikes by limiting excess electrical current through blocking its flow or shorting it to the ground.</p>

<p>Lights, like all sources of electricity, can also cause electric shock, so ensure you always turn the light switch off before replacing a light bulb, and never replace a light bulb or touch a light switch with wet hands.
