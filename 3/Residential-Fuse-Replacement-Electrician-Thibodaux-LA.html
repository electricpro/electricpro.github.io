<p>It is best, then, to have a professional install these low voltage landscape lights to minimize the risk of physical equipment damage. When installing dimmers or smart dimmers, avoid CFL bulbs as they are not compatible with a lot of dimmers even though the bulbs say "dimmable." Smart light switches fall in the middle of the cost range, being less expensive than a fleet of individual bulbs and a bit pricier than smart plugs. 120 volt systems must maintain absolute moisture free which is difficult with the wires running underground.</p>
<p>In addition to electric-specific licenses, several states require electrical contractors to obtain a generic contractor license. Backyard ponds benefit from underwater lights , while in-ground well lights provide an elegant, warm glow. If you are looking for a truly unique track lighting system, our Longmont electricians can help design a customized monorail fixture for you.
