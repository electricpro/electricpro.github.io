Surges can be caused by birds, small animals, falling trees, or vehicles crashing into power poles, but the most obvious is lightning. Voltage indicators are pen-like pocket tools used to check for the presence of AC voltage over 50 volts. On this particular receptacle box, the black wires go with the gold screws.
