Most homeowners call electricians in an emergency or if they're building or remodeling. Portable backup generators range in price from $500 for a 3,250-watt unit to $1,500 for a 10,000-watt unit.</p>
<p>Never use them with extension cords. Choosing the right emergency electrician can be a very difficult decision to make especially if you are facing a stressful situation. Any electrical contractor that you hire should be technically proficient, reputable, and financially stable, and should demonstrate a thorough understanding of your business. We partner with Kohler backup generators, bringing you an efficient and reliable source of power, perfectly sized to your requirements.</p>
<p>The U.S. Fire Administration recommends the following organizations as trusted and reliable sources for free outreach materials you can use to help increase awareness about home electrical fires in your community.
