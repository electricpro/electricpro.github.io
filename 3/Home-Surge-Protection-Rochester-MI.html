One interesting thing to note about electrical service panels is, unlike a lot of the appliances you use in your home, service panels slowly decline over several months before they finally stop working. The standard time for lights of this nature to light up is typically five minutes.</p>
<p>This page provides a handy checklist of electrical safety basics and offers insights into how and what to teach your kids to keep them safe around electricity.
