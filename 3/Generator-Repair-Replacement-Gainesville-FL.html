<p>Low voltage lights can then be installed throughout the interior landscape to showcase trees, ornamentation, foliage, gardens, and flower beds. If a Prometric (formerly Block & Associates) examination is passed (a requirement for licensing in all local jurisdictions), all licensing jurisdictions will honor the passing score when considering an applicant for licensure. Basically, the electrical current flows from the wall to your surge protector and then to your electrical devices.</p>

In case you are looking to design or redo your home's lighting, then you might be considering to do this as a Do-It-Yourself project.
