The transformer is where the power gets converted from line voltage to low voltage and needs to be installed somewhere nearby. In areas where water is present, use outlets with "ground fault interrupters" or GFIs. With the advancement of technology, we put more and more strain on the electrical panel.</p>
<p>For example, if you add up the wattages of all your fixtures for a total of 200 Watts then you at least need a transformer with a maximum output of 200 Watts. Whether or not a half-hot outlet is for lighting is debatable, but you must still have a neutral in the switch box. Color output from LED lighting is also variable. Light switches tend to have a long lifespan, but you should be aware of the warning signs that your switches should be replaced. Inspect tools, power cords, and electrical fittings for damage or wear before to each use.</p>
<p>Master Electricians: For this license, you need to obtain a degree in electrical engineering along with two years of work experience in construction wiring, and installation.
