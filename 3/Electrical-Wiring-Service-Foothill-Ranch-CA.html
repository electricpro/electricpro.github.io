This can leave homeowners with electrical wiring that is not really suitable for the higher electrical needs we have today.</p>
<p>It's often referred to as the main breaker box or fuse box. Right before and immediately after the storm, people tend to purchase portable generators; once the debris has cleared, many purchase standby” generators, which are more powerful than portable generators (and more expensive) and are installed in the home.
