You may have difficulty selling your home if you do not have the right electrical safety certificates. However, there is a general understanding within the electrical trade of the standard duties and skills associated with residential electrical installation, upgrades and repair. The correct safety procedures to be used in troubleshooting electrical equipment will be explained in detail.</p>
<p>In most cases, two black wires will be attached to the switch's two terminal screws. Note: to be contractor in Queensland, you need to apply for the Queensland Electrical Contractor Licence under Mutual Recognition. Apprentices receive less pay than fully trained electricians, but their pay increases as they learn to do more. Fire and shock are the only known hazards from electrical wiring.
