PowerPro technicians are experts in all aspects of industrial generator service and generator maintenance. This would compensate for the initial high cost of preparing these for landscape lighting. The circuit breakers at this 1,219 MW nuclear power plant had been in use since the facility opened in 1986. In any situation, we can only offer home generator repair services when your generator is currently conforming to all applicable building codes.</p>

LED lighting is also a great choice because it is much less expensive than traditional incandescent lighting (saves as much as 50% on power usage) and can last much longer as well.</p>
