Just as everyone's homes and electronic devices are different, do their need for surge protection will be different, but, ultimately, the more ‚Äòlayers' of surge protection between a surge and your devices, the less likely they are to become damaged or destroyed. This is particularly true with a generator since the whole point is protecting your family during an already-stressful power outage.</p>
<p>Unlike high voltage, Class 1 wiring, Class 2 wiring need not be installed by a licensed electrician. Residential electricians install wiring and troubleshoot electrical problems in peoples' homes, which can be either single-family or multi-family dwellings. Although lighting brings your garden and exterior amenities to life at night time, facade or feature lighting to the exterior of your home should also be considered. All your electrical appliances and components share a common factor: the breaker panel.</p>
<p>All backup generators we carry are backed with a guaranteed written warranty for parts and labor.
