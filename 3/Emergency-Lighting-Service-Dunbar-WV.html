<p>Electricians install, maintain and repair electric power in rural, residential and commercial areas. Apprenticeship Electrician: Must be at least 18 years old and pass an exam. But if there is the slightest danger that wires will be nicked by someone driving a nail into a stud though which the wires are run be sure to use steel plates to protect the wire where it passes through the studs. Let a licensed electrician deal with electrical issues. However, you probably don't even notice that at this moment, many of your electronic devices are experiencing a voltage spike.</p>
<p>Tip: If for some reason you cannot finish connecting the switch or outlet and have to complete it at another time, you can place wire nuts over the ends of the unconnected wires and turn the electricity back on until you have the time to finish the job. Consider having a qualified electrician add more circuits or outlets so you do not have to use extension cords. If you find that your circuits trip regularly, your lights flicker infuriatingly often and the need to unplug the fridge to make your hairdryer work is beginning to get on your nerves, it's time to upgrade your panels.</p>
