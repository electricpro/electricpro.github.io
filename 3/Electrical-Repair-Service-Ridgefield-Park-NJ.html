If you have a standby generator outside the home, you'll want to build a small enclosure around it. If you have a portable generator, which you can move in or out of a garage or some other covered location, you probably just need a cover.">

<p>The licensed electricians at Stack Electric want to pass along some general electrical safety tips to make sure all of our customers are "playing safe" around electrical equipment and wiring.

For those not concerned with resale value at the moment, lighted backyards create additional useable space for you and your family at night.</p>
<p>Lighting Tip: You can run 12-gauge about 100 feet without voltage drop issues as long as the total wattage of the fixtures on the wire is 100 Watts or less. But when the power goes out and an electrical system fails because of a tripped breaker, faulty wire, or natural disaster, it seems as if everything stops. Because electricians must travel to different worksites, local or long distance commuting is often required. All power outlets should be earthed or grounded to prevent electric shocks.</p>
<p>Our power grid could not function without it. And there are many electrical devices, like pumps, that need high voltage to operate. As a rule, light fixtures that have lasted for about three decades (25 years plus) in any given building is prone to unstable power supply. A half-hot (or switched) outlet is a duplex outlet that has one half permanently "on" or ready to provide electricity while the other half can be turned off and on via an ordinary wall switch.</p>
