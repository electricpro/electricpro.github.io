<p>Illuminate the night with amazing, stylish and affordable landscape lighting. Our experienced project managers and electricians know how important installing the correct lighting is to the success of your commercial space.

<p>Remove the wall plate covering the existing switch by unscrewing the two screws. Electric current travels from point to point because there is a greater electric potential energy on one end of the wire than there is on the opposite end. When you're ready to schedule a service, give us a call at 804-329-1000 , and one of our commercial electricians will arrive at your property as soon as possible.

Our approach to the commercial lighting installation, commercial lighting repairs and commercial lighting replacement is different and wholesome. As part of an upgrade to wiring new properties new fuseboards are often offered to enhance the safety of your property.</p>
<p>A good electrician will be able to install a quality home surge protector into your panel. Its size makes it perfect for small and medium-sized homes and it monitors when it's close to overloading so it can stop power supply to unimportant circuits to keep the vital appliances running. Overloading and doubling up of circuits is commonly seen on older outdated fuse panels, the result of improper installations that were never inspected. You can pick one up for a few bucks and use it to test for hot wires or to find a neutral.</p>
<p>Take note that appliances have also been a common cause of fire, so proper usage guidelines should be followed and electrical overloads should be avoided. A kite and its string may conduct electricity - sending it right through you to the ground.
