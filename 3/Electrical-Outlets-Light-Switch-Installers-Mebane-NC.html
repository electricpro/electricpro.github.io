<p>Most outdoor lighting systems use low voltage lighting which is employs 12 volts of electrical devices instead of the usual 120 volts that are used at home or in offices.

It's safer and more reliable than using individual extension cords, but it can add as much as $1000 to the total cost with professional installation. It is safe: As long as the circuit breaker to the outlet or light is flipped off - and you have double-checked this with a voltage tester - you can work on those items in complete safety.</p>

<h3>Why Hiring Qualified Electrical Contractors is Extremely Important in Mebane NC</h3>
<p>Turn OFF electricity at the main fuse box (or the circuit breaker box) that controls the power to the fixture or the room you're working in. Low voltage landscape lighting systems uses a transformer which lowers the electrical output to the lights. Each receptacle has a 120-volt ‚Äòhot' wire, a neutral wire and a ground. This is especially true if you're using a permanent standby power generator. This generator is fitted with a Vanguard V-Twin OHV engine that allows for easy conversion between liquid propane and natural gas during installation.</p>
<p>Like a car, an emergency standby generator is powered by internal combustion engine that can run nonstop for days at a time, so they require a considerable amount of maintenance. Electrical panels are one of those things that just work until they don't. When it detects an interruption in your main utility service, it safely switches you from that power source to the standby generator's power. Industrial projects require highly skilled personnel with Safety training and equipment.</p>
<p>This means that 12-gauge wire will work for your landscape lighting system. Outdoor landscape lights are used to highlight trees, gardens, fountains, walkways and anything else that you want to call attention to. Not only are these lights beautiful in their own right, but they also increase general nighttime visibility, which improves safety and discourages would-be intruders. The Electrical Safety Foundation International found that each day, seven children must be treated for injuries caused by electrical shock.</p>
<p>While our technicians specialize in Generac, we are able to provide regular generator maintenance services to any make or model generator. The best way to prevent damage during from lightning storm is to unplug devices that could be irreparably damaged. All installations were done at the designated times. Our electricians can work with any make of surge protection. You may not, however, use a GFI outlet (it is not possible to modify one so that only half of it is switched), but the entire outlet could be switched.</p>
