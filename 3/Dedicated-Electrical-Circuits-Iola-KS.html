<p>Many homes in New England have fuse boxes and electrical panels that are 50 years old or older. Low voltage landscape lighting comes in all varieties of sizes and styles. The kilowat rating of a generator is going to tell you how many appliances you can power, more information on that can be found below. Thread the long ground wire through the hole in the top of the special green wire connector and splice all the ground wires by holding them together and twisting the connector clockwise until it's tight.</p>
<p>This was fine in the past, but homes usually require updated panels to handle the higher payloads of modern-day electronics. Wiring by owners must comply with the same standards as required of Electrical contractors. With our whole house generator installations, you can have peace of mind knowing that no matter what's happening outside your home, you'll be safe and comfortable indoors.
