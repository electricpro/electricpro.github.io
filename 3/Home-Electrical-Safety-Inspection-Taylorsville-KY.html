<p>By installing a circuit breaker sub panel, you make it clear which circuit breakers and branch circuits apply to which parts of the house. 99% of the time this is the reason they will not turn on.

<p>Applicants may substitute education in electrical curriculum for up to 1 year of the required 4 years of experience. Excessive voltage drop is critical to the proper operation of the luminaires and the length of run may require larger wire than 12 AWG to ensure proper voltage to the lighting units.
