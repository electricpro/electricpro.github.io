<p>Other than a lower startup cost, another advantage of owning a propane-powered standby generator is that liquid propane can be stored in a tank on the property. In addition to these services electricians also do the wiring to new build properties, extensions, & conservatories. One with more than 20kW of power can cost up to $6,000. This being the case, it is then no wonder that the company continues to require the expertise that only electrical engineers can provide.</p>
