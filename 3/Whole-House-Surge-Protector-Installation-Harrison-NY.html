<p>For your own safety, always unplug a lamp when you change the light bulb. Sometimes, it makes more sense to replace your panel rather than repair it. We offer both repair and replacement services , and we'll discuss the pros and cons of each option to help you make the decision that is best for your situation. Most homeowners call electricians in an emergency or if they're building or remodeling. Portable backup generators range in price from $500 for a 3,250-watt unit to $1,500 for a 10,000-watt unit.</p>

Low voltage landscape lighting helps people find paths and walkways in unfamiliar, dark territory and when installed in overhead features systems light up surfaces used for cooking and serving food, such as BBQs and tables.

Generators come in two basic designs: standby generators and portable generators. Every house can create their own power through electric generators. With a standby Generac generator, you're never without electricity for more than a minute.</p>

Some of the switches are doubled or tripled together because they power appliances that require large electricity loads, such as air conditioners and electric dryers.

There are many different light installations that can help enhance the visibility and aesthetics of any room in your house.</p>
