<p>If you are still using the fuse-based electrical system, you need to upgrade the electrical panel with circuit breakers. Electricians must be able to see tiny components, including wires. Also, within the broad CII category, commercial construction is the top money maker at 26.7 percent of revenue, versus 13.6 percent for industrial projects and 8.6 percent for institutional work. In many older homes, the circuitry is hooked into a fuse box as its primary control panel.</p>
<p>Never plug one surge protector into another surge protector or power strip. The lights have clamps with metal teeth that pierce the cable insulation and tap directly into the power line. If at the switch, you have power between black and ground but none between black and neutral the most probable answer is a disconnected white neutral somewhere. You will need to find an existing contractor who is a licensed electrician to train you for a few years, keeping the necessary logbooks to submit for your application to take the electrical licensing examination.</p>
