<h3>Generator Repair & Maintenance Hopkinton MA 01748</h3>
<p>Test each light fixture for its voltage level with a digital voltage meter (about $25 at Radio Shack). The black wires in the cables are used for connecting switches. Always practice electrical safety when performing any home repairs, and never attempt an electrical repair if you have any doubts about your knowledge or abilities. This indicates there are 4 cables and that one of the black wires is not connected. A no voltage reading locates the trouble in the control circuit; the OL2 is faulty.</p>
<p>Fuses are outdated and don't trip like the circuit breakers. Generators help supply homes with a continuous flow of power in the case of an outage, allowing homeowners to still run appliances like air conditioners, security systems, refrigerators, heaters and lights while the power is down. Safety - Simply put, if you aren't completely sure of what you're doing, you shouldn't be doing it. Your home or business's electricity is not something you want to mess with.</p>
