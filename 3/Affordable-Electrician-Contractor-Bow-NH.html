<p>Solar lights generally function for 8 to 10 hours. Two cables entering an outlet box indicate that the outlet is not the last fixture on a circuit. Some common sense safety precautions include making sure your hands are dry and not standing in water when performing electrical work or when accessing your electrical panel. We want all our customers to stay safe when using electricity, whether at your home, farm or office. We don't have a qualified or licensed electrician in our company hence I'm trying to get mine so i can do installation as well.</p>

Install that dimmer back into the box and put your cover plate back on and now you will have control over your for some reason you go down stairs, and you turn your circuit breaker back on and you come upstairs test the outlet you have just installed and it doesn't work, what you want to do is go back and double check your terminals and make sure the wires that you have installed are tight and in the proper location, and if there are any other wires or wire nuts in that box check them to make sure they are tight, once you have double checked all your connections, you can turn your circuit breaker back on and check you outlet, you should be fine.</p>
<p>Provided that you know how to work on electrical wiring without getting killed by electrocution, you (or your electrician) will open the switch box, carefully pull the switch assembly out enough to inspect for additional wires that may be present, and then use a VOM or DMM or even a simple neon tester to determine what wires are present. We understand that having an electrical issue arise after hours can be very troublesome. The panel white and black wires should never be connected together, although it is common to use a white on the wire going to the switch to splice to the panel black wire.</p>
