Overheating occurs in outlets or electric panels. This course can also be adopted as part of a company's regular Qualified Electrical Worker program.Course ObjectivesDay One begins with a review of safety before moving to electrical drawings, meters and troubleshooting basics. First, you can wire the receptacle so the incoming wires connect to one pair of hot and neutral screw terminals on the receptacle, and the outgoing wires connect to the other pair of screw terminals.</p>

It's not a huge deal if you mix them up, as it will simply switch to the bottom receptacle being the switched one—you can always switch them back. Be careful not to dislodge any wires from the switch terminals - the wires should still be firmly attached to the screws on the switch holding them in place.</p>
