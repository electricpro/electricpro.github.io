<p>When it's time to replace your electrical panel, our services are just a tap away. Older homes' electrical panels often top out at 60 or 100 amps, but most newer homes have 200-amp panels that meet your family's electricity needs now with plenty of room for future growth. The voltage drop in the main power wires from the generation source or the battery to the bus should not exceed 2 percent of the regulated voltage, when the generator is carrying rated current or the battery is being discharged at the 5-minute rate.</p>
<p>For example, if you add up the wattages of all your fixtures for a total of 200 Watts then you at least need a transformer with a maximum output of 200 Watts. Whether or not a half-hot outlet is for lighting is debatable, but you must still have a neutral in the switch box. Color output from LED lighting is also variable. Light switches tend to have a long lifespan, but you should be aware of the warning signs that your switches should be replaced. Inspect tools, power cords, and electrical fittings for damage or wear before to each use.</p>
