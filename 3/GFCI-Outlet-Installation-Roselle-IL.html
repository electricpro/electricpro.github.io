Outdoor fixtures like these are made specifically to withstand any type of weather condition included rain, snow, and ice. The Electrical Safety Foundation International (ESFI) reports over 28,000 home fires a year in the U.S. are caused by arc faults.</p>
<p>Remember to be cautious about troubleshooting such light installations as these bulbs could be lead to potential danger. Power strips â or better yet, surge protectors, which absorb common power surges that can damage electronics â are an inexpensive and safe way to add extra outlets in most circumstances. Typically a standard feature on stationary generators, it's increasingly common on portables. Just one short surge of electricity could lead to the destruction of the electricity supply unit and render your apparatus worthless.</p>
<p>Commercial indoor lighting maintenance- Includes regular inspections, fixture cleaning and bulb replacement.
