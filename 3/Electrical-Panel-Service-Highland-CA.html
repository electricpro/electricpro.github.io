<h2>How To Hire Residential Electrician Service in Highland</h2><p><img src="https://electricalimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/electrician.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>It is also possible that your home is of more recent construction and the switch has a neutral in the box as required by code, but is not connected to anything. The white wire is commonly used as the LINE down to the switch and must be re-indentified with a different color to indicate that. Or you could remove the wires from the switch and tie those two together, bypassing the switch. Refueling-If your generator runs on gas, this step won't apply to you because the gas is sourced from an outside pipe.</p>
<p>The white wires allow current passing through the outlet and the other loads on the circuit to return to the panel. Your home backup generator will simply cycle on automatically when the power cuts out, and will continue powering essential circuits in your home to keep you safe and comfortable for the duration of the power outage. Typically when I see a switch wired from a receptacle box the switch is being used to make one of the receptacles switchable while leaving the others always -on.</p>
