<p>Illuminate the night with amazing, stylish and affordable landscape lighting. Our experienced project managers and electricians know how important installing the correct lighting is to the success of your commercial space. After installation, our generators are tested and ready to go. Best of all, low-voltage deck light systems don't require you to take the precautions necessary with household 120-volt systems because they are not powerful enough to give you a serious shock.</p>
<p>This type of generator is installed permanently at your home (typically in the yard) and is connected directly to the electrical panel of your home. Our surge protection devices (SPDs) and modules are designed to provide protection from transient overvoltage. Make sure all electrical outlets are three-hole, grounded outlets. Similarly, electrical appliances should never be handled with wet hands as this heightens the chance of getting an electric shock.
