<p>As a homeowner, it's wise to know where the breaker panel in your house is located in the case of an emergency or the sudden need to cut off or restore power. Since Georgia is faced with a substantial amount of thunderstorms each year, surge protection is a concern for every Georgia homeowner and consumer. Too few switches, outlets and lights. Either way, the only method of making it a half hot - half switched and half unswitched - is to run another wire to it. Relocate cords instead of overloading outlets.</p>
