<p>These fuse boxes worked fine for small homes that didn't use much electricity, but today's electrical usage (with air conditioners, furnaces, and so on) require a higher electrical capacity. The entire fixture is constructed of 100% brass with a removable mounting bracket increasing its uses for small, hard to light spots such as under railings or up-lighting rafters.
