<p>At Hoffman Electrical, we provide commercial standby generator installation and repair, so your Clearwater business can stay open when your competitors can't.

Also, they need to perform work under the supervision of a licensed supervising electrician. You would then proceed to check the power contacts, overloads , and lead connections within the controller.</p>

<p>Because there's little risk of electric shock, Hart says he likes to turn the lights on while installing low-voltage systems.

To do this, you will need to briefly touch together specific pairs of the wires: touch the common wire (typically white or yellow) to the ON wire (typically red) to turn the light ON. Next touch the common wire to the OFF wire (typically black) to turn the light OFF.</p>
