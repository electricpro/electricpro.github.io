<h3>Should I Use Surge Protection for My Home Appliances in Inwood NY?</h3>
<p>No matter how great your surge protection is, if lightening strikes your house, all bets are off. According to the National Institute for Burn Medicine, more than half of all burn accidents involving infants and children can be prevented by lower water heater settings. The best solution is to put all three white wires, plus an additional one about 6" long, into a wire nut. We are a fully accredited and certified company that performs the necessary electrical work.</p>
<p>When designing or wiring landscape lights, it is extremely important not to go over the wattage capability of the transformer, plus by having the extra wattage available, will allow you to add more lighting to your system in the future if you desire.

When you turn on a power hog like an air conditioner or your computer it creates a power surge to "kick start" it. This can cause internal damage to the equipment.</p>
