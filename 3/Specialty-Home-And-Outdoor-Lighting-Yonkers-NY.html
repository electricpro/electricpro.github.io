<p>Because electrician licensing regulations and electrical code often varies from state to state - and even from jurisdiction to jurisdiction within a state - there is no official, universal job description for residential electricians. Both wires and cables use labeling to tell you about the wire size, the material, the number of wires inside a cable, the type of insulation, and other special ratings. Capabilities exist to modernize and extend the life of the active components, i.e., circuit breakers, while leaving the existing switchgear structure intact.</p>
<p>For example, if you add up the wattages of all your fixtures for a total of 200 Watts then you at least need a transformer with a maximum output of 200 Watts. Whether or not a half-hot outlet is for lighting is debatable, but you must still have a neutral in the switch box. Color output from LED lighting is also variable. Light switches tend to have a long lifespan, but you should be aware of the warning signs that your switches should be replaced. Inspect tools, power cords, and electrical fittings for damage or wear before to each use.</p>
