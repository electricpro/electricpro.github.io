There are basically two types of generators that can be used in an emergency: portable and permanent standby generators.</p>
<p>By purchasing the proper outlet surge protector you are taking a preventive measure that can save you thousands, not only in terms of equipment but in data as well. It's not a huge deal if you mix them up, as it will simply switch to the bottom receptacle being the switched one—you can always switch them back.
