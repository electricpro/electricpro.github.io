Evaluates electrical systems, products, components, and applications by designing and conducting research programs; Salary 50 Thousand To 1 Lac P.A.</p>
<p>Like everything in life, it pays to be prepared in the event of an electrical emergency. While they may only seem like a minor nuisance when it comes time to plug in a new appliance with three prongs, these older outlets need to go. Outdated and inefficient, they lack the proper grounding plug newer outlets have, which means they're more likely to cause an electrical fire in your home.

To get the most accurate size panel for your home, we recommend having a professional electrician calculate your home's electrical load. Always make sure your circuit breakers can handle the load you give them. If you notice an acrid smell from your panel or notice any discolored marks near to the circuit breakers, there is the chance of an electrical fire If you observe signs of a fire, you should immediately look for services to upgrade the electrical panel.</p>
