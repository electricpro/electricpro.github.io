<p>The average electrical panel upgrade takes about 8 to 10 hours to complete.

<p>This voltage drop is why you're seeing your lights dim. Furthermore, when low voltage fixtures need maintenance, the skill of that labor to understand the system and identify where a transformer that's powering a low voltage fixture is could come at a premium. It is most common to put the red wire on the bottom screw, since that will make the top plug-in "hot" at all times and will be a little easier to plug things into it.

<p>The consumer unit also protects the house's electrical appliances (and eventually you) by having incorporated within it either fuses or circuit breakers which automatically break the circuit if a fault occurs. The 5th step is to wire the lights. As the name suggests, surge protectors are there to protect electronics from blasts of electricity. A low-voltage wiring system in buildings may be used to operate line-voltage lights, receptacles, motors, or other devices.</p>
