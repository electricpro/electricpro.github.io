<p>If your circuit breaker fails, it will not stop the flow of electricity when exposed to hazardous conditions. On the other hand, if you want your house to remain lit even during a power outage, you can opt for a small sized generator. PRECO offers surge protection (PDF) to members to help stop indirect surges that could damage or destroy household wiring and large appliances such as air conditioning and refrigeration equipment. A computer system stands to lose gobs of important data in the 10 to 20 seconds between the time the power goes out and the generator starts pumping electricity.</p>
<p>A common problem is a switch that does nothing or an electrical outlet that is not functional. Experience: Typically, a residential electrician uses single phase power supplies - 120 or 240 volts. Lay the wires alongside the lights - but do not attach yet. The BLS reports that jobs for electrical contractors are expected to increase 23 percent between 2010 and 2020. Although circuit breakers and electrical panels are safer and more reliable than fuse boxes, they are still prone to problems now and again.</p>
