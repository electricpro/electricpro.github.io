<p>Perhaps you've rearranged your furniture and realized that you need more lighting in a certain area of a room, or you may need more lights in a naturally dark space like a garage or basement. Surge protectors prevent that from happening. To use a portable generator without the hassle of running extension cords, hire an electrician to install a manual transfer switch subpanel off your main circuit panel and install a dedicated inlet to power the subpanel (installing the subpanel is complex; not a DIY project).</p>
<p>Some electricians — especially those who haven't been around for a while or who aren't really savvy with the code — will steer customers in a different direction just for not having the correct knowledge,” Volpe says. Can provide service for the lifetime of the generator. This is because these circuits will likely take appliances that draw greater amperage.
