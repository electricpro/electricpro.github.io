<h3>Reasons To Upgrade Your Electrical Panel Groton MA 01450</h3>
<p>Portable generators are more reasonably priced, starting at about $300, but they tend to be substantially less powerful and don't turn on automatically when the power goes out.

This can leave homeowners with electrical wiring that is not really suitable for the higher electrical needs we have today.</p>
<p>The cost of not replacing your electrical panel may be much higher if your panel starts a fire. It has a multilingual LCD display to monitor generator status, check for any maintenance, and utility power presence. Whether you want to prepare for winter snow and ice storms or summer hurricanes, or just make sure your business never loses power throughout the year, Davis & Green Electrical is your source for quality generator installation and maintenance.
