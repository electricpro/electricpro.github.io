<p>With a properly planned electrical maintenance schedule and a reliable contractor, you should never have the need to attempt to replace your old wiring or something like that, because that would be a dangerous thing to attempt a DIY on.

Journeyman License: You need to have a minimum of two years of experience. Our licensed Electrician will inspect your home's entire electrical system looking for any safety hazards and potential energy saving recommendations.
