<h3>Commercial Electrical Services Vs Residential Electrical Services in Hahira GA</h3>

<p>Make the space in the new panel for the breakers. Backup home generators can keep your most important appliances up and running from computers, fridges, and necessary medical devices. Similarly, inside box 2, attach the black wire from the three-wire bundle (black, white, copper) to the black terminal on the new switch.

<p>In order to know the gauge of the wire and the circuit information, you'll have to check the cable-sheath labeling. Watch out: if the "hot" wire in your light switch is on a 3-way circuit you may not always have power at your add-on receptacle.
