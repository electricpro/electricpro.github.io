<p>I was looking at some height requirements on electrical outlets this is a very informational site. Plus, many LED fixtures offer a higher brightness output, which is ideal for outdoor applications. You should be able to replace your Douglas switches with Touch-Plate light switches However if the relays or other parts are not working, you'll need to do a Touch Plate System Upgrade, which will use your existing wiring, but require updating wall switches and relays to modern Touch Plate low voltage parts.</p>

Adding an electrical outlet next to an existing light switch is easy, as long as there is a neutral wire in the box.</p>
<p>If you notice a burning smell or see any burn marks near circuit breakers, there is a good chance there was a small fire. Landscape design and lighting is no exception to this.
