Even a little rain can damage a generator, and you'll end up spending a lot of money to fix it. If you have a standby generator outside the home, you'll want to build a small enclosure around it. If you have a portable generator, which you can move in or out of a garage or some other covered location, you probably just need a cover. Since generators are used in case of emergencies, it's vital that they are installed correctly and are poised to work efficiently.</p>

If you notice an acrid smell from your panel or notice any discolored marks near to the circuit breakers, there is the chance of an electrical fire If you observe signs of a fire, you should immediately look for services to upgrade the electrical panel.</p>
