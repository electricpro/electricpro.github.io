As your service panel is the heart of your home's electrical system, it's critical that it's updated to meet today's energy demands and safety requirements. There are just too many horror stories about electrical projects going wrong with unlicensed and uninsured electricians, even when these contractors came personally recommended.</p>
<p>Upgrading an electrical panel is a serious endeavor that must be handled by a professional; this is not a DIY task. With todays technology, high voltage for landscape lighting is useless. Propane-fueled generators are often smaller than other types, and larger-sized models can be costly to acquire and run. The box with the switch in it thus has a "hot" wire, permanently hot, a neutral and a ground. The location of the switched receptacle is not specified either. We can deliver you the high quality preventative maintenance services you need to have peace of mind in knowing that your home's electrical system is always in the best condition possible.</p>
