This course is designed to familiarize participants with the use of basic troubleshooting procedures to troubleshoot problems in electrical circuits. Unplug unused appliances and stow cords safely out of reach of pets, young children or hazardous situations. Turn the power back on at the circuit breaker. Getting your electrical panel inspected and repaired as soon as possible will keep your family connected and safe.</p>
<p>Once you're sure that power is shut off to the wire that will be fed into the old-work box, insert the old-work box into the drywall opening with the power wire running through the drywall opening and fed through the old-work box with at least six to seven inches of the wire exposed (you can use a wire stripper to strip the wire ). Secure the old-work box to the drywall with screws, wire and mount your new light switch into the old work box, and then secure it to the wall with screws.</p>
