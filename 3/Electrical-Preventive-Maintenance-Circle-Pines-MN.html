<p>Journey Worker Electrician - You must show proof of five years and more than 10,000 hours of experience in residential or commercial wiring. After the first hour, you'll be charged for the actual time it takes the electrician to do the job. This is a sign that the old electrical wiring in your home isn't able to run enough electricity to appliances. Or, proof of 8,000 hours experience as a journeyman with 20 to 50% of the experience being completed in residential work.</p>
