Power strips or extension cords are often used to allow several different electrical items to pull power from one outlet. 1 out of 5 Easy Digging shallow trenches for the low-voltage cable takes some work, but installing the light fixtures is a piece of cake. Even if you're a skilled DIYer, consult with a professional before installing new wiring or electrical appliances.</p>
<p>A line of switches on the wall can detract from the room's style. Low-voltage landscape lighting for the backyard needs only an outdoor receptacle and a transformer. After completing this course, participants should be able to describe hazards associated with faults and overloads, describe the operation and common types of circuit breakers and fuses, and describe basic procedures for troubleshooting problems with circuit breakers and fuses. Your electrical services provider will know all the safety precautions they need to take and can even identify potential problems before they take hold.</p>

This isn't too surprising, as being an electrician often means crouching, kneeling and bending to reach the electrical installations you're supposed to be working on.
