There are just too many horror stories about electrical projects going wrong with unlicensed and uninsured electricians, even when these contractors came personally recommended.</p>
<p>Electrical panels are sized in amperes (amps), a unit that measures the flow of electrical current. Buy a 'single-pole' switch if one switch controls the lights or a 'three-way' if you have two switches controlling the same lights. Master Electrician - You must have 2,000 hours of experience working as a licensed journeyman electrician under the supervision of a contracting master electrician. At least 6,000 hours of this experience must be considered commercial or industrial.</p>
