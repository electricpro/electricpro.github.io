It actually sounds like this is the problem; confusion over what color goes where in those wires from the switch. The hot source wire is removed from the receptacle and spliced to the red wire running to the switch.</p>

Never place items that are combustible near to fuse boxes, meters or electrical appliances that give out heat such as a microwave. This course will reinforce understanding of the operation and use of various types of test equipment used to measure current, voltage, and resistance.</p>
<p>This guide will walk you through the steps to take to make you and your home as safe as possible when it comes to electricity. Upon completing an electrician apprenticeship program, candidates must pass journeyman electrician testing before becoming a licensed electrician. Your local Mr. Electric can perform all your lighting repair tasks and many other electrical services at your residential or commercial location. If a 12-2 cable is run from the panel to the outlet, then a-20 amp circuit breaker is the largest that can be installed to protect the circuit.</p>
<p>If your home has an electric panel that is more than a generation old, it could be time for an upgrade. The position of the contacts can be verified by visual inspection or by removing power from the system, ('''CAUTION''': Circuit must be locked, tagged, and tried) lifting the leads to the temperature contacts, and using an ohmmeter to verify that the contacts are closed. You can avoid overloading your generator with surges by turning on connected appliances one at a time.</p>
