<p>Chemical finishes, such as our classic "Matte Bronze" and "Rusty" have changed the landscape lighting world forever and are the envy of our competitors (who have been trying for years to duplicate our signature finishes). At Arrow Electric, Inc., we can provide you with a whole-house surge protection to insure your home and electronics from unpredictable power surges. There is no problem too big or small and we can handle all electrical panel problems with effectiveness and efficiency.</p>
<p>Personalized Service: Our technicians will inspect your home and determine the correct generator needed to power all your appliances and systems. They can be installed in the ground to uplight statues, fountains, flag poles, trees, or your company logo.

Not only can preventive electrical maintenance save businesses time and money, but by keeping equipment functioning properly, the risk of hazard is greatly reduced and the work environment becomes a safer place.</p>

Path lights, accent lights and deck lights enhance the unique styling of your home while offering the functionality and peace of mind of a well-lit outdoor space or hardscape design.
