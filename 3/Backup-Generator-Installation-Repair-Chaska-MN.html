<p>Portable generators vary in price and size, so it is best to evaluate how you are going to be using your generator before purchasing it. Unlike whole-house generators, you have to manually add fuel to your portable generator before each use. Here in Lake and Porter Counties, where the threat of power outages is year-round, a whole-house generator can prove to be a good investment for your home or commercial property in Crown Point or the surrounding areas.</p>

<p>Moisture can wreak havoc on a home's electrical system and this generally shows at the panels. It is perfectly acceptable to change colors throughout your home, for example satin nickel switches with stainless steel plates in a kitchen, bright red switches on a dramatic accent wall, black outlets in a bathroom with black marble counters or tiling, or pleasing almond electrical wiring devices in a bedroom.
