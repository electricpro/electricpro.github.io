Even a little rain can damage a generator, and you'll end up spending a lot of money to fix it. If you have a standby generator outside the home, you'll want to build a small enclosure around it. If you have a portable generator, which you can move in or out of a garage or some other covered location, you probably just need a cover. Since generators are used in case of emergencies, it's vital that they are installed correctly and are poised to work efficiently.</p>

A 100-amp breaker box may be sufficient for households with minimal use of electricity, but most modern homes require 200 amps. Note: Cast brass AMP® ONE fixtures feature a lifetime warranty. Nonetheless, it is still definitely worth consideration, especially by those who are looking for a portable home backup power generator running at no less than 15,000 watts.
