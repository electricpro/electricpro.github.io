<h3>Protect Your Home With a Whole House Surge Protector in Christiansburg VA</h3>
<p>The popularity of outdoor living has brought a new focus to outdoor lighting. From landscape lighting to area lights and architectural sign lighting. Avoid overloading extension cords, power strips, or outlets. Most breaker boxes are 100, 150 or 200 amps. Trust Graf Electric to professionally upgrade or service any type of commercial indoor lighting. It will also give you the peace of mind that the electrical panel is not the hazard it once was. Then, it might be a good idea to look into a standby generator installation.</p>
<p>Moisture can wreak havoc on a home's electrical system and this generally shows at the panels. It is perfectly acceptable to change colors throughout your home, for example satin nickel switches with stainless steel plates in a kitchen, bright red switches on a dramatic accent wall, black outlets in a bathroom with black marble counters or tiling, or pleasing almond electrical wiring devices in a bedroom. Security lighting systems should provide bright light and motion sensors, in consideration of a homeowners' lifestyle.</p>
