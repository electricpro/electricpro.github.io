<p>It covers essential circuits or whole house coverage, and produces clean power for sensitive electronics and appliances. Even a little rain can damage a generator, and you'll end up spending a lot of money to fix it. If you have a standby generator outside the home, you'll want to build a small enclosure around it. If you have a portable generator, which you can move in or out of a garage or some other covered location, you probably just need a cover. Since generators are used in case of emergencies, it's vital that they are installed correctly and are poised to work efficiently.</p>
<p>Never use them with extension cords. Choosing the right emergency electrician can be a very difficult decision to make especially if you are facing a stressful situation. Any electrical contractor that you hire should be technically proficient, reputable, and financially stable, and should demonstrate a thorough understanding of your business. We partner with Kohler backup generators, bringing you an efficient and reliable source of power, perfectly sized to your requirements.</p>
