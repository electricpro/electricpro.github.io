Transformers are very convenient since they provide only a small amount of voltage to the lights as well as control the length with which the lights are turned on which allows homeowners to save up on electric bills. These run on liquid propane or gasoline, which can be in short supply during long power outages.</p>
<p>If your home has an electric panel that is more than a generation old, it could be time for an upgrade. The position of the contacts can be verified by visual inspection or by removing power from the system, ('''CAUTION''': Circuit must be locked, tagged, and tried) lifting the leads to the temperature contacts, and using an ohmmeter to verify that the contacts are closed. You can avoid overloading your generator with surges by turning on connected appliances one at a time.</p>
