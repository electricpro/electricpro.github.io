This is perhaps not a project which you should do without help from an electrician, but if you have a permit, you can upgrade your power panel on your own.

<p>Common wires for landscape lighting are 10-, 12-, 14-, or 16-gauge wires. Removing the breakers, during a fuse box upgrade or circuit breaker repair must also be handled with care. Anything Electric approaches every Roswell lighting repair with the highest level of professionalism. Don't be tempted to tape damaged cords.
