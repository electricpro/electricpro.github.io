Surge protectors work by blocking voltage spikes to a less dangerous threshold and preventing damages from happening to your devices. Before doing this you can also try having a new load calculation performed on your service to see if you can reduce the size of your main breaker.</p>

The electrical contractor can then offer a list of options for reducing power use or improving energy efficiency. In general, there are two types of generators: portable and standby. As a rule, no electrical circuit should sustain loads of more than 80% the maximum capacity.
