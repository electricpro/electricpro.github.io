<p>Electric panels are used to regulate the flow of electricity for your home while also being the main location of all electrical circuits. Sometimes the wiring at a light box is passing the circuit through to various outlets in the area, so that care must be taken to connect everything back as it was. In this manner, the power must go from the receptacle box to the switch, through the switch and return to the receptacle box and GFI. Lighting repairs are an important because lighting is a part of the look and feel of a New Castle County home.</p>
<p>Turn the power off at the circuit breaker. If you find yourself using extension cords very often, consider having an electrician install new outlets throughout your home. What this rating means is that it can handle greater surges than devices with a lower In rating. Turn the power back OFF at the service panel, carefully remove the receptacle from the electrical box, mark pairs of wires LOAD & LINE, or LINE & SWITCH LEG and remove the remaining wires from the receptacle.</p>

Remember, if your house electrical wiring system has no ground, properly installed GFCI receptacle WILL PROTECT YOU from electrical shock, but it will not provide grounding path for the connected equipment. Electrical defects can happen at any time and can jeopardize your safety most of the time.</p>
<p>Smaller yards or gardens are better suited for low voltage systems because of the smaller area to light. That's why so many of our Montgomery County, Howard County, and Frederick County neighbors install home backup generators —so that they're prepared in the case of an (all too likely) emergency due to the crazy weather in our area.
