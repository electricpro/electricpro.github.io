Homes with 120-volt service (the typical size) can use an 80kA-rated surge protector as surges over 50kA are unusual. Just like most things in a home, some elements of an electrical system need to be replaced from time to time, and this might include the electrical panel.</p>
<p>Limited - If you have not completed an approved apprenticeship program, you must show three years of experience supervised by a licensed master or limited electrician. Simply put, this method allows easy troubleshooting and insures proper distribution of power across all lighting fixtures. If you would rather keep that protection, install the neutrals just as they were, put a jumper between the GFCI (where the undersink black wire used to be) and the new switch, then put the undersink black to the switch.</p>
