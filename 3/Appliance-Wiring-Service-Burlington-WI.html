Safety: Another essential advantage of having an outdoor lighting system is safety.</p>
<p>Many states require seven years of experience as an electrician or a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering for certification as a master electrician. It is recommended to use a higher transformer wattage and larger cable size to allow for adding more lights. Master Electrician - You must have at least four years of experience as a licensed journeyman electrician. Attaching fixtures to one cable in a daisy chain can overpower the lights closest to the transformer and leave the last few power-starved and dim.</p>

Any damaged or frayed wiring is means for short circuiting or residential fires. Your home relies on circuit breakers to protect its electrical system from both overloaded circuits and short circuits.</p>

<p>Splicing: When splicing wiring in the house, it is key to display matching wire sizes and types. Ensure cords are not broken, frayed or damaged. Avoid using electrical items near water or in the rain. Check for other special features of the outdoor lights such as motion sensor that makes the light automatically turns on whenever it detects movements or automatically turns off once the movement stops.
