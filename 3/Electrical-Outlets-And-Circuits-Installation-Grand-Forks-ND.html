With our knack for design using quality LED lighting, we take pride in the fact that our customers trust us to design and create a beautiful nighttime effect for their house, landscape, or property that will enhance curb appeal and increase security. However, choosing an outdoor light fixture for your house is so stressful. Circuit breakers in the main panel cut power to individual circuits if they start to draw more current than is safe.</p>
<p>But most older breaker panels can't handle anywhere close to the sum of all your home circuits. Always tape extension cords to walls or floors when necessary. Pushmatic panels have weak breaker switches that get harder to reset over time. LIGHTING DESIGN Plan your lighting design by selecting features to enhance, and areas that need light. Thus, the owner is responsible for all issues related to the electric service panel.
