<p>Browse all surge protection products, including SPDs for industry. Many people in older homes need to upgrade their panels to meet the demand. In some states, electricians can receive both a license and a certification. From our smartphones and tablets that constantly need charging to our televisions, gaming systems, and countless other electronic devices, we are just about always relying on our homes' electrical systems to power the things that are vital in our daily lives.</p>
<p>Federal Pacific circuit breaker panels, with their faulty Stab-Lok breakers, still lurk in many older homes, says Volpe who replaces at least 300 each year.

Electrical breakers that trip frequently need troubleshooting and should be repaired to remedy this dangerous situation. Of course, when it comes time to make any major electrical or wiring changes to your home, be sure to only have licensed and insured electricians do the work.</p>
<p>If you live in old house whose electrical system has not been upgraded and still uses a fuse box instead of a modern electrical panel with multiple circuit breakers, you should replace it as soon as possible.

The whole fixture is used as a heat sink for the LED to ensure it continues lighting for years to come. The electrical panel is an important and foundational part of your electrical system. For instance, if you have a Federal Pacific or Zinsco electrical panel, you should know that these were very common in the 70s and 80s.</p>
<p>Important thing to remember - if you decide to install GFCI receptacle in a place of the existing electrical outlet, you should perform this installation following your current local jurisdiction requirements - this might not be entirely the latest NEC (National Electrical Code) but should be very close to it - find out required GFCI locations based on the latest NEC. The number of households with generators could double over the next 10 years,” says Giampetroni—and, indeed, it has roughly doubled from 10 years ago, he says.</p>
