<h3>Should I Use Surge Protection for My Home Appliances in Mc Lean VA?</h3>
<p>Frequently moving fixtures around can result in damage to the lights themselves. While transfer switches for standby power backup systems are usually automatic, you can also get a manual transfer switch for your generator if you so choose. Our team of skilled electricians can efficiently repair and rewire your light fixtures and test them for proper functionality so you get bright, efficient lighting without any headaches. Our surge protection can help preserve life-saving medical equipment, important data, invaluable electrical systems, and more.</p>
<p>Like everything in life, it pays to be prepared in the event of an electrical emergency. While they may only seem like a minor nuisance when it comes time to plug in a new appliance with three prongs, these older outlets need to go. Outdated and inefficient, they lack the proper grounding plug newer outlets have, which means they're more likely to cause an electrical fire in your home. Excellent services, details of job explained clearly up front. The best way for me to install these is to have a 12V power supply in the basement (probably just a computer power supply) and pull 2-conductor cables up from there.</p>
<p>Our outdoor lighting contractors place your lights against a surface with the beams pointed up. This creates a shadow that illuminates the wall's or stone work's texture. The bare copper wire that is nearly black was a clue in tracking down a neutral and ground wiring failure at this building. Our lighting contractors are licensed, bonded and extremely professional. Group and label the wires in the switch boxes so you'll know how to connect them after the drywall is complete.</p>
<p>Standby generators connect to your home's fuel supply (natural gas or propane). At the outlet box, if there are cables other than the new 3-wire you are using to connect the outlet to the switch, splice them together by color: Black wires together, white wires together, and all ground wires (including the one in the 3-wire cable) together, all with like-colored pigtails. The amount of protection offered by a surge suppressor is measured in joules. NRTLs such as Underwriters Laboratories (UL), Edison Testing Laboratories (ETL) and Canadian Standards Association (CSA) test appliances to ensure they comply with OSHA's electrical safety rules.</p>
