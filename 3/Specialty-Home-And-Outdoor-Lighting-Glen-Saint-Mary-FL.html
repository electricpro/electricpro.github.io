Safety: Another essential advantage of having an outdoor lighting system is safety.</p>
<p>Good design practices may segregate, for example, low level measurement or signal cables from trays carrying high power branch circuits, to prevent induction of noise into sensitive circuits. You can design your wire route so that it reaches each fixture and then returns to the transformer.

The whole fixture is used as a heat sink for the LED to ensure it continues lighting for years to come. The electrical panel is an important and foundational part of your electrical system.
