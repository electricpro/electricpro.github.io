<p>This is one of the largest Generac generators available, which provides home & business owners with the best value per kilowatt available in the market today. The panel determines how much power is available for distribution from the circuits to the appliances, lights, and outlets. An external solar panel allows he homeowner to position the panel in direct sunlight while positioning the solar fixture in a shaded area. Then connect the black hot wire coming from power to the brass screw.</p>
<p>Unlike the silent portable units , a standby whole house generator is installed permanently on a concrete pad and connected directly to your home's electric box to provide uninterrupted power that can kick in automatically.

<p>Important thing to remember - if you decide to install GFCI receptacle in a place of the existing electrical outlet, you should perform this installation following your current local jurisdiction requirements - this might not be entirely the latest NEC (National Electrical Code) but should be very close to it - find out required GFCI locations based on the latest NEC.
