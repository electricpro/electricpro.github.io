If electrical panels are allowed to age too fire they can become a serious hazard to your home or business.</p>

The generator offers a power capacity of 15,300 watts on natural gas and 17,000 watts on liquid propane. For these reasons, it is imperative that the maintenance electrician, technician or engineer uses a troubleshooting methodology that enables them to isolate the problem in the shortest amount of time.</p>
<p>Standby generators connect to your home's fuel supply (natural gas or propane). At the outlet box, if there are cables other than the new 3-wire you are using to connect the outlet to the switch, splice them together by color: Black wires together, white wires together, and all ground wires (including the one in the 3-wire cable) together, all with like-colored pigtails. The amount of protection offered by a surge suppressor is measured in joules. NRTLs such as Underwriters Laboratories (UL), Edison Testing Laboratories (ETL) and Canadian Standards Association (CSA) test appliances to ensure they comply with OSHA's electrical safety rules.</p>
