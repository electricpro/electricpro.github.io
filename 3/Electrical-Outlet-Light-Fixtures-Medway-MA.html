<p>This type of electrical box has fuses that burn out when they become too hot. Also, it has a higher price tag than a gasoline generator costing between $1,900 and $5,000. This system provides control over all the generator's functions, including automatic transfer switch control, start and stop features, weekly testing and exercise functions, and utility monitoring.

Bill Locklin the inventor of the original 12 volt garden lighting system in the mid 1950's knew better than anyone how potentially dangerous 12 volts can be and in some cases even more dangerous than 120 volt main power. Since it's solar powered you don't have to rip apart your garden to install electrical wiring-just place the sturdy stakes into the ground and that's it. Solar landscape Lights will run up to 10 hours per night and will effectively light up your garden, driveways, patios and walkways making for much safer outdoor environment.</p>
