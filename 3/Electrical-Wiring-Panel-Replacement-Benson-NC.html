<p>The best and the most affordable option are to go for low voltage cable lighting. From the ceiling junction box, the cable splits off, and travels to each of the other boxes in the circuit. Most low-voltage lighting systems include a transformer that is plugged into a regular outdoor electrical outlet. Make sure that gold and silver screws on the old and new switches correspond. Complete the rough-in phase of the wiring job by connecting the appropriate wires with wire connectors, adding short lengths of wire (pigtails) where they're needed and folding all the wires neatly into the boxes.</p>
