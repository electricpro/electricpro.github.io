<p>Decide where you will plan to use landscape fixtures and the type of light you expect them to provide - uplighting, silhouetting, grazing lighting, wall washing, etc. While this is often sold to new installers as an easy-to-install method, it results in decreased efficiency (higher electrical costs due to resistance created by small-gauge cable pre-attached to the fixtures) and the drain of your transformer's power capacity. 3. Replace or repair damaged electrical cords to keep your home safe.</p>
<p>Identifying the source of the problem requires the technician to isolate components and evaluate circuit parameters, to isolate the circuit by group when dealing with a complicated circuit (half-step approach), and to identify the malfunctioning component using the recorded data.
