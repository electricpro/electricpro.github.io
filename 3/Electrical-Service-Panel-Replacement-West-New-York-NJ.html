The gasoline generator is also less fuel efficient compared to diesel generators. Buying a larger generator will consume more fuel to power the same appliances that a smaller generator could. However, since I expect the generators to run flawlessly (when everything else does not) and do not want to rely on external companies to help with servicing and maintenance - these kinds of issues decrease its value in my eyes.</p>
