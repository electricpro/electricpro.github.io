<p>The standby generator and the transfer switch are installed by a professional to the home's existing electrical wiring. When you call our 24-hour emergency electrical service, you will talk to a licensed electrician who will ask you a few questions about your residential problem and dispatch an emergency electrician as soon as possible. Just answering the question as to whether you need the system to power the entire house or just emergency loads will help you determine the transfer switch size.</p>
<p>The unpredictability of outages gives stationary, permanently installed standby generators a clear advantage over their portable, gas-powered kin, which resemble big lawn-mower engines on dollies. Supervision Electrician: You need to show proofs of 4 years of experience as a licensed journey worker electrician. Purchasing a generator from Electric Generators Direct provides you with the same service options as if you were to purchase one from your local home improvement warehouse.</p>
<p>For good landscape lighting that is a feature of your garden, varying the types of lighting and their placement will add more aesthetic interest. Putting it into easily digestible words, a standby generator works with two major parts: it works with the generator itself and with a transfer switch. Be conscientious because, even though you've got the power off to the circuit you're working on, there are most likely wires behind your wall, and you don't want to get into a live circuit behind your wall.</p>
