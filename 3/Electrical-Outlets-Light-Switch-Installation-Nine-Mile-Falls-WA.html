<p>2500-joule energy rating provides maximum protection of all your sensitive electronic devices. In order to understand which generator transfer switch is best for your installation, it's recommended to speak with a generator specialist. It was in the UK in 1881, that a Siemens AC alternator was used to light up a street electrically for the first time. Even if you turn off power, electrical wiring can be tricky and is best left to the professionals. The TLC folks promptly responded and scheduled a time to repair or replace right away.</p>

To keep appliances safe, research the wattage requirements and electrical loads before powering them up through a generator. To do this, you will need to briefly touch together specific pairs of the wires: touch the common wire (typically white or yellow) to the ON wire (typically red) to turn the light ON. Next touch the common wire to the OFF wire (typically black) to turn the light OFF.</p>
<p>Electricians install, maintain and repair electric power in rural, residential and commercial areas. Apprenticeship Electrician: Must be at least 18 years old and pass an exam.
