<h3>Electrical Contractor Duties and Responsibilities in Granite City IL</h3>
<p>Circuit breakers can be tripped many times without requiring replacement. Licensure and certification requirements vary by state, but typically include passing an exam that covers the National Electric Code, as well as state building codes and regulations. Make sure to buy a transformer that can handle the lighting load you need it to. A transformer will be rated at a certain wattage; make sure that the wattage of your transformer exceeds the sum of the wattages of all your lights.</p>
<p>Shown in this wiring diagram is the power from the circuit breaker panel going to an electrical receptacle outlet and then continues to the next outlet and then to a single pole wall switch and then to another outlet. I just wire nutted the Black wires at the switch and used red for the hot to the switch (and then the switched side of the outlet) and black then at first outlet for always hot side. We create quality, long lasting, energy efficient , lighting schemes, and extreme outdoor lighting designs.</p>
<p>Applicants applying for a residential electrician's license must present proof of insurance, and: (1) Have four (4) or more years experience in the practice of electrical construction and obtain certification form a residential contractor license holder that the applicant has the experience and knowledge to qualify for the license sought; or (2) Pass the required examination for the particular license sought.
