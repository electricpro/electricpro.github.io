LED or Halogen Systems: As with everything else in lighting, the market is quickly going to LED. Although tripping is normal, if your electrical panel is tripping all the time, it likely means that you need more power than your current system can provide and that you'll need an upgrade to your home's wiring and electrical panel.</p>
