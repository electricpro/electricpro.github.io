<p>Like a car, an emergency standby generator is powered by internal combustion engine that can run nonstop for days at a time, so they require a considerable amount of maintenance. Electrical panels are one of those things that just work until they don't.

Industrial projects require highly skilled personnel with Safety training and equipment.</p>
