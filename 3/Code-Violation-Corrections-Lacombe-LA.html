If another outlet is connected through the outlet, an outgoing black wire may be connected to the second brass terminal and the white outgoing wire should be connected to the other nickel colored terminal. Investing in a whole-house generator means you will always have backup power should you need it. Having a licensed electrician perform regular maintenance at your home and office will also lower your risk of problems in the future.</p>
<p>The source neutral is connected to one of the neutral terminals on the receptacle. Landscape lighting is an important safety element for any outdoor space.

<p>If the duration of the increase is longer than three nanoseconds (billionths of a second) it is referred to as a "surge," if the duration is less than that, then it is considered a "spike." A surge can cause significant damage to electronic equipment (particularly computers and modern multimedia systems).
