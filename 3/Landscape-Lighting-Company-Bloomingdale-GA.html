Outdoor fixtures like these are made specifically to withstand any type of weather condition included rain, snow, and ice. The Electrical Safety Foundation International (ESFI) reports over 28,000 home fires a year in the U.S. are caused by arc faults.</p>

Despite this lengthy life span, building owners are obligated to perform routine maintenance and testing to ensure their egress lighting systems are fully functional when an emergency arises. This will allow the switch or outlet to be mounted flush with the wall which will make it easier to use. Attach the wire to each light fixture; many low voltage light fixtures use quick connectors to make this process simple.</p>
