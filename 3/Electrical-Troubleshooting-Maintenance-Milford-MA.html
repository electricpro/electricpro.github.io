<p>When an electrical panel needs to be replaced, upgrading the service should also be considered. Professional generator installation is the best way to avoid this issue. Before you replace the fuse, be sure to turn off all electrical appliances on its circuit, particularly those that you suspect may have caused the fuse to blow. Permanent home standby generators are also considered as automatic systems. This article also covers lighting equipment connected to a Class 2 power source.</p>

<p>A heavy-up electrical panel upgrade improves the safety and reliability of your electrical system, adds value to your home or business and gives you peace of mind.

Turn the power back on and wearing electrically insulated gloves with glove protectors, and a face shield CAREFULLY (You can get shocked or electrocuted) check with a volt meter or pigtail light bulb to see which wire is the LINE.</p>
