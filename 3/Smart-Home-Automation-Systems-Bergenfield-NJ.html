<p>Children must learn that appliances such as hair dryers and electric shavers are not toys and must never be played with in the bathroom. The system was installed a few days later and the technicians (Mark and Kara) did a very thorough and professional installation. Next, unroll the spool of low-voltage electrical cable and lay the cable beside the fixtures. With preventive maintenance, you'll not only save money on future repairs but also protect your family from the dangers of an electrical issue.</p>
<p>Not all UL listed SPDs are necessarily rated for use with a lightning protection system. Surges can be caused by birds, small animals, falling trees, or vehicles crashing into power poles, but the most obvious is lightning. Voltage indicators are pen-like pocket tools used to check for the presence of AC voltage over 50 volts. On this particular receptacle box, the black wires go with the gold screws. The reason is electrical contractors use it and most of the time in buildings and homes.</p>

Watch out: if the "hot" wire in your light switch is on a 3-way circuit you may not always have power at your add-on receptacle.
