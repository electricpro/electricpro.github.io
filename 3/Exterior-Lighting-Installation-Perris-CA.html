When wiring landscape lights, determining voltage drop is very important so you don't have dim lights at the end of your run. Most of the time, you don't think much about your breaker panel. Water - Before using an extension cord outside or in a wet area, confirm that the cord is rated for outdoor use and make sure the cord is connected to a Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter.</p>
