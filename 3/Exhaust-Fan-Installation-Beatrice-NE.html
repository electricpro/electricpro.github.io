<p>To install and service Generac & Honeywell generators. Don't go outside to check the damage before an electrician arrives, especially during a storm, as fallen power lines are easily concealed and can be deadly. Teach all family members to avoid touching electrical devices when they are wet, in water, or standing on a wet surface. If you are looking for a system to power your heater and one other appliance (a total of 16 circuits), purchase the 11kw generator at $3,000.</p>
