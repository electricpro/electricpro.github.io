<p>If your home seems dark and gloomy or like it just came out of a scene from a scary movie, it might be time to consider adding some outdoor lighting. Or you can buy big 5-kw banks that cost $5,000 and will keep a few critical circuits in the house going for several hours or days (if used sparingly).

<p>Pulling on a cord can damage the appliance, the plug or the outlet. If you are planning a home lighting design project, you obviously want to leave the task to someone who knows what they are doing. A master electrician is not only permitted to work on his own, he is the one who can bid for jobs, pull permits, lay out wiring systems and installations.

<p>Standby generators permanently connect to your home's or business's electrical system. Some stranded aluminum wiring is still used in houses today for the main service entry wires and other 240 volt circuits like ranges and clothes dryers. Every generator has a fuel source that it's powered by. Unless you are using a wind generator, you will most likely have to store fuel in preparation for power outages. Tip: Don't bury the cable more than 3 inches or you'll have difficulty connecting the light fixture.</p>
