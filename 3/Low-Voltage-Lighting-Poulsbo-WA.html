<p>Switch boxes and ceiling boxes can have neutral, or they can be without neutral wire. But there are a couple of things almost any homeowner can do to promote electrical safety, such as labeling circuit breakers and wiring, and replacing old outlets with GFCI ( ground-fault circuit interrupter ) outlets. Compare whole house generator installation costs from around the web. Be aware of the fire risk that damaged power cords pose, and the fact that extension cords are only intended for temporary use.</p>
<p>To determine the cost of a failure, it helps to consider three key categories: Loss of income due to downtime, cost of labor to troubleshoot, repair and restart and cost of damage equipment.
