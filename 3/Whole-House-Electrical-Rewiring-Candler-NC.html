Low-Voltage Lighting. Because of a circuit breaker's time-delay feature, it may not need to trip for months, even years on circuits with light loads. This poses a safety issue because many old circuit breakers won't trip when they are called upon to. This could be a potential fire hazard as heat builds up possibly breaking down components of your wiring and leading to a fire.</p>
<p>Issues typically present themselves in a variety of ways, including regular popping of breakers, electrical outlets that only work occasionally, and breaker panels that are a discombobulated mess.
