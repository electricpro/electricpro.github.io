<p>Master Electrician: Must complete 2,000 hours as a licensed journeyman under a contracting master electrician. If you find yourself using power strips or extension cords in your home, then it's a strong sign that you are using more electricity than your home was designed for. Each lighting fixture is hardwired, with special attention paid to the concealment of unsightly wires, which are usually buried underground whenever possible. There will be three wires: one black, one white, and a separate ground wire that may be bare copper or is sometimes wrapped in green.</p>
<p>The electrical plan is determined for a house by a licensed electrician Dallas Texas inspector and the wires are laid. Unless you have extensive electrical knowledge, it is best to leave the installation of pendant lights, accent lighting and overhead lights to professionals Use this guide to get a better understanding of the costs associated with installing a light fixture in your home.
