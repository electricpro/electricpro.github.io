With just a few years of paid training you can learn to become a licensed electrician and get this career off the ground.

<p>First, connecting the wires leading to downstream outlets with wire connectors creates a more secure connection. Hook the wires onto the new receptacle. We didn't buy a whole-house generator because I didn't want to run out of fuel with an extended power loss.
