<p>Our professional San Diego lighting experts can help you design your landscape lighting and choose the best options for the right areas. This means that sometimes there is a great deal of electrical power being carried through the wiring between a point of electrical generation and a final electrical load. Businesses rely on electrical power every day to maintain their operations and keep their lights and other appliances on. Don't get caught without power when severe weather rolls through or your electric company experiences a blackout—make sure your business has a working commercial backup generator installed.</p>
<p>This type of generator is installed permanently at your home (typically in the yard) and is connected directly to the electrical panel of your home. Our surge protection devices (SPDs) and modules are designed to provide protection from transient overvoltage. Make sure all electrical outlets are three-hole, grounded outlets. Similarly, electrical appliances should never be handled with wet hands as this heightens the chance of getting an electric shock. For on-call and reliable emergency services in Bucks County, A-1 Electric's ready to assist you all your electrical needs.</p>
