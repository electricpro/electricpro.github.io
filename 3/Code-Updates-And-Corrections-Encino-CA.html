<p>Install your outdoor low voltage lighting system and enjoy the rewards. And they cannot carry the electrical current that a copper wire with the same size can. When power comes on again you can turn the switch off and disconnect the generator and return your setup to normal. Low voltage landscape lighting is used to highlight paths and light up landscape features and buildings. An overload can cause a fire, so it's the job of the electrical panel to break the circuit and regulate the electricity in the system to keep your home and family safe.</p>
