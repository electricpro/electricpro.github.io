<p>If your electrical panel is very old and not designed to handle the electrical usage that is currently taking place, you may be facing a serious fire hazard. Service personnel came out and laid out the bed for the generator and installed a platform around the generator bed.

<p>After your new generator is installed, worrying about a power outage will be a lot less of an interruption in your life. Once the electricity comes back on, the generator will go back into standby mode and wait for the next time it's needed.
