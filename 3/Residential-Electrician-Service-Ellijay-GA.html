The white (neutral) wire connects to the silver screw, or you place it in the back wire hole on the same side of the device as the silver screw. The white wire is the "neutral" wire, which takes any unused electricity and current and sends them back to the breaker panel.</p>
<p>If the breakers in your older home trip often, it could mean that your modern appliances are too powerful for the electrical system, or there's faulty wiring.

<p>Fleet management and maintenance consulting services for commercial and local government markets. Just as everyone's homes and electronic devices are different, do their need for surge protection will be different, but, ultimately, the more ‘layers' of surge protection between a surge and your devices, the less likely they are to become damaged or destroyed. This is particularly true with a generator since the whole point is protecting your family during an already-stressful power outage.</p>
<p>In most cases, two black wires will be attached to the switch's two terminal screws.

The amount of protection offered by a surge suppressor is measured in joules.
