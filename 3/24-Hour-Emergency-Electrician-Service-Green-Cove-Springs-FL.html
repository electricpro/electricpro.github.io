<p>All generators mentioned on our list give you the option to choose between natural gas and liquid propane as fuel. More information about National Electrical Safety Month, including the complete 2012 NESM Toolkit and the How Do You Know?‚Äù program can be found on ESFI's Web site at -. With all of the wires reconnected and your new wire in place, carefully tuck the wires back into the electrical box. Always use ladders made with non-conductive side rails (e.g., fibreglass) when working with or near electricity or power lines.</p>
<p>Keep cords away from sources of heat and water. You can't just plug in the TV ‚Äî there's the TV and the receiver and the Roku and whatever else.‚Äù The group resorted to plugging power strips and extension cords into virtually every outlet. When you replace fuse box with breaker panel, your home becomes safer. Do not overload outlets with multiple adaptors or power strips; relocate cords instead.

Once removed, take your fingers and pull the outlet out of the junction box to expose more of the wires.</p>
<p>Standby generators connect to your home's fuel supply (natural gas or propane). At the outlet box, if there are cables other than the new 3-wire you are using to connect the outlet to the switch, splice them together by color: Black wires together, white wires together, and all ground wires (including the one in the 3-wire cable) together, all with like-colored pigtails. The amount of protection offered by a surge suppressor is measured in joules. NRTLs such as Underwriters Laboratories (UL), Edison Testing Laboratories (ETL) and Canadian Standards Association (CSA) test appliances to ensure they comply with OSHA's electrical safety rules.</p>
