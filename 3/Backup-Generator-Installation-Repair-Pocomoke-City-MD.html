You have now installed a new electrical outlet and can take advantage of the safety and convenience of relocating your power needs. Circuit breakers keep tripping: This is an indication your electrical panel may be wearing down and should be replaced.</p>

The main circuit breaker shuts off the electricity to the house in one move.

If you notice an acrid smell from your panel or notice any discolored marks near to the circuit breakers, there is the chance of an electrical fire If you observe signs of a fire, you should immediately look for services to upgrade the electrical panel.</p>
