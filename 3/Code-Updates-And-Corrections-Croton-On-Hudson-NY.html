<p>No matter how great your surge protection is, if lightening strikes your house, all bets are off. According to the National Institute for Burn Medicine, more than half of all burn accidents involving infants and children can be prevented by lower water heater settings.

We are a fully accredited and certified company that performs the necessary electrical work.</p>

We understand that electrical issues are not only a major inconvenience but can also be potential fire hazards.</p>
<p>Today, most homes have what is officially called the electrical service panel, or simply, the service panel. Check for a second hot wire also present in the same box. Unlike standard lightbulbs, recessed lighting bulbs are concealed within the wall or ceiling, creating a pleasant lighting effect without being noticeable. LED lights are also flexible.
