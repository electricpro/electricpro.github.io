<p>When it comes to your Birmingham home's electrical system, there are a number of different components that all work together in order to supply your home with the steady stream of power you have come to expect, and your electrical wiring is a major component within that system. A whole-house surge protector is a device installed to protect all the appliances in your home from any electrical spikes by limiting excess electrical current through blocking its flow or shorting it to the ground.</p>
<p>They help reduce costly downtime and protect sensitive electronic equipment against the damaging effects of transients caused by lightning, utility switching, internal load switching and more. There are two levels of certification for master electricians: general journey level and specialty master electricians. A power outage can occur during at any time and can last for days or even weeks.

It's also important to note that kitchens should always be wired with ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) outlets to prevent accidental electric shocks.
