<p>Power generators have two main components. If they look OK, then you'd use your DMM to see if there's power to them, and, of course, on the motor side of each one. Maintain your whole house generator regularly by having a scheduled maintenance routine to ensure it lasts long enough. To maintain proper polarity when wiring a receptacle, connect the black hot wire to one of the hot bronze-colored terminals. Add a few feet for each fixture so you have some slack and the ability to relocate the fixtures slightly.</p>
<p>However, self-installation and self-repair can be both dangerous and confusing. Because multiple devices (nodes) are connected, the ground potential at different nodes could be different, which can cause ground currents to flow through "the path of least resistance" via either the common earth ground or the ground wire. The modest expense of an emergency electrician is a small price to pay to keep your home and family safe. When you have a power outage, the generator automatically detects the problem and starts to provide backup power.</p>
