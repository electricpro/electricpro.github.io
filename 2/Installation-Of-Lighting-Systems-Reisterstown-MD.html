<p>Changing an electrical service panel isn't like changing a fuse or wiring a new ceiling fan. An electrical surge is an unexpected and uncontrolled spike in voltage on an electrical circuit. Recessed lights are installed so that the fixture is unseen.

Service personnel came out and laid out the bed for the generator and installed a platform around the generator bed. An electrical contractor is permitted to apply for a permit from the local governmental jurisdiction to engage in electrical wiring at a specific job site.
