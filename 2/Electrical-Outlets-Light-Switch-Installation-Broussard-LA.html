<p>Electrical maintenance personnel are responsible for keeping circuit breakers and switchgear working properly and for performing periodic inspections and any necessary repairs. If you are in the process of building a new home, our licensed electrician contractors can help to lay the groundwork for reliable wiring in the early stages. Moreover, it's advisable to install the generator as close as possible to its fuel supply and the transfer switch.
