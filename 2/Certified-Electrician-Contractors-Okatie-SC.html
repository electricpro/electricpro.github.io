In order to make a stronger connection you can also bypass this connection altogether, splitting the cable and wiring it with wire nuts as you would a traditional light fixture.</p>
<p>Electricians install, maintain and repair electric power in rural, residential and commercial areas. Apprenticeship Electrician: Must be at least 18 years old and pass an exam. But if there is the slightest danger that wires will be nicked by someone driving a nail into a stud though which the wires are run be sure to use steel plates to protect the wire where it passes through the studs.
