Or, you can ask the builder if you know who that is. If all else fails, a professional electrician can help you find the panel. A new circuit breaker or service panel will give you upgraded electrical capacity throughout your home. Limit your choices to those devices that are truly essential during a power outage and you'll keep your total costs down.</p>
