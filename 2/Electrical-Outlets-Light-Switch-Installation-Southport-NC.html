If you are a licensed builder or tradesperson in NSW, you need to get home building compensation (HBC) cover for each home building project over $20,000 including GST. Well-executed outdoor lighting casts your home in the best possible light and adds what realtors refer to as curb appeal.” Outdoor lighting can also add security and value to your home; ensuring a solid return on your investment.</p>
<p>For example, if you add up the wattages of all your fixtures for a total of 200 Watts then you at least need a transformer with a maximum output of 200 Watts. Whether or not a half-hot outlet is for lighting is debatable, but you must still have a neutral in the switch box. Color output from LED lighting is also variable. Light switches tend to have a long lifespan, but you should be aware of the warning signs that your switches should be replaced. Inspect tools, power cords, and electrical fittings for damage or wear before to each use.</p>
<p>Make the space in the new panel for the breakers. Backup home generators can keep your most important appliances up and running from computers, fridges, and necessary medical devices. Similarly, inside box 2, attach the black wire from the three-wire bundle (black, white, copper) to the black terminal on the new switch. Unlike other maintenance and repair tasks that can be quickly fixed, when dealing with electricity it is always best to call a professional. Unfortunately, many Bergen and Hudson County homes still have outdated electrical panels or are in need of replacement for their circuit breakers and electric meters.</p>
