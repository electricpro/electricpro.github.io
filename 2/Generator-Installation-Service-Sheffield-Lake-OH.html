That is why it is said that electricity is always looking for a path to ground (lower potential). Reach out to the professionals at All Seasons Air Conditioning & Heating to learn more about our comprehensive electrical services and how they can help your home run more efficiently. The source for the circuit is at the switch and 2-wire cable runs to each receptacle outlet.</p>

<p>3. Whole-House protection - This is what I had mentioned above. While it is true that most people can safely re-wire a plug and there is no need to call an electrician for that one, any tasks more complicated than that, including fitting replacement switches; would be better left to the professional unless you know exactly what you are doing. But models featuring outlet with built in surge protector are also present.
