<p>Remove the top black wire and splice it to two 6" jumper wires. Upgrading an existing panel to 200 amps (which is currently a required minimum standard) costs between $850-1,150. A switch doesn't actually use a neutral wire; it simply takes hot” current from one location and either opens or closes the loop back to the device. Each generator must also be matched to an automatic transfer switch (ATS), which serves as the brains of the standby-power system and tells the generator when to kick on and turn off.</p>

<p>Electrical engineers who successfully land a job in the esteemed firm have the chance to grow not just their skills but their respective careers as well. Electricians must take precautions to avoid getting hurt.

Our mission is to heighten awareness of the benefits of surge protection to all users of low voltage electrical systems in North America for the purpose of promoting proper application and usage.</p>
