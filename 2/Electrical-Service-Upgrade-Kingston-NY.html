However, these older apartments with obsolete electrical panels may not be able to support your modern electrical needs.

If you find a coil you suspect to be burned or otherwise causing trouble, repair or replace it and try the circuit again before attempting any other changes. A careful study of this section of the control circuit should show us what contact must close to energize this coil.</p>
