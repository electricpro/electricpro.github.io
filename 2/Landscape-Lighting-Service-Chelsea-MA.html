<p>Cloth wiring is another very tricky topic for a lot of home inspectors, electricians, and insurance companies. Low-voltage transformers need an outlet that connects with your home's electrical system. Diesel powered generators are more durable and have a higher fuel efficiency. You'll never have to refill or set-up in inclement weather as it runs off the home's natural gas or liquid propane line. Joe 'Connell Electrical Contracting has extensive experience in servicing all electrical needs associated with knob and tube wiring and would be happy to assist you as needed.</p>
