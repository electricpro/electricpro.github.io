As your wiring ages and starts to deteriorate then you might see the flickering of lights, experience shock while touching an appliance, find a burning smell near appliances or see any faded black marks around the panel.

Circuit Breakers have a big advantage over fuses in that if thy are tripped they can be easily reset by simply flipping the switch to the offf position and then back to the on position. These systems commonly use a transformer or power supply to convert 120 volts from an outdoor receptacle outlet to a lower voltage at the secondary of the power supply. When lightning strikes near a power line, it increases the current flow along that line a million volts, possibly more.</p>
