If there are two brass screws for the black wire, and a breakable tab between them, it might be possible. Your final step is to turn on the transformer to ensure that the lights work. If you are the type to use many electronics in your home then you are aware of the energy needed to run all that equipment and the inconvenience of having to unplug all of them when they are not being used.</p>
