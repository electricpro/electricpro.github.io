<p>Keep a flashlight near your electrical panel at all times, just in case of a power loss. Whether you're just looking to add more outlets, or want to add a layer of protection between your gear and the outside world, you'll eventually want to buy a surge protector.

<p>These devices are extremely sensitive to the quality of power. The only safe and sure way to know if your home was wired with aluminum is to get your wiring checked out by a qualified electrical contractor familiar with the subject. If your circuit breaker fails you, call an electrician for repair services right away.

Use 14-gauge cable for lighting systems that total 200 watts or less and 12-gauge cable for systems that are more than 200 watts. A specialized engineering analysis may be needed to provide sufficient protection, especially in situations of high lightning risk. Practicality-wise, if a device is able to handle the usual fluctuations in power supply and current flow, you don't need to hook it up to a surge protector.</p>
