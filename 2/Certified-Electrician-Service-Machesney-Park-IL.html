Check and replace any electrical components that have worn, cracked or frayed cords and only use appliances in good condition. No cover plate on the electrical box.

<p>Install ground fault circuit interrupter outlets in potentially hazardous areas such as near pools, crawl spaces, kitchens, bathrooms and unfinished basements. Electricians may obtain additional certifications, which demonstrate competency in areas such as solar photovoltaic, electrical generating, or lighting systems.
