Many injuries occur in the kitchen and bathroom areas, because of their proximity to water and the most common injuries are from electrical appliances, frayed electrical cords and overhead power lines.</p>
<p>In the most basic of terms, when a home backup generator system senses a power outage it will make the automatic transfer in a matter of seconds to ensure that all electrical circuits are powered normally. From 2003 - 2007, 53% of electrical failure home fires involved other known types of equipment. The constant plugging and unplugging of appliances into outlets and turning lights on and off cause wear and tear over time.
