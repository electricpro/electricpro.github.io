Wiring diagram shows how the electrical power enters the ceiling light electrical box and then a two conductor cable is installed to the switch without a neutral conductor.

<p>Although it is permitted to wire lights and receptacles on the same circuit I usually avoid doing that for the sake of the people living in the home. You're in your business, and you're darn good at it. Unfortunately, that means that many (or most) electrical contractors all look the same. Generally, the more joules the better, as this means the device can handle one large surge, or multiple smaller surges, before your gear is in danger.

Contact a residential electrician when you want to install, upgrade, or repair the following: home electrical wiring, a new electrical power panel, lighting systems, and major appliances (for example, a Jacuzzi) in your house or condo, which will usually have single-phase electricity.
