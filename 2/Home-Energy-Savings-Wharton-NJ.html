<p>Ensuring your electrical systems are up-to-date is a major issue to keep your home safe. The white neutral wire in the new switch box complies with NEC 2011 requirements. Therefore, you want to experience a slight voltage drop to all lamps in your low voltage lighting system. Make sure that you check the age of your electrical panel in your home and consider a circuit panel replacement if your system is 25 years old or older. The simplest installation is one where the power source and new outlet are within the same wall segment but face opposite directions.</p>
<p>Voltage indicators are useful when checking for breaks in AC wiring. Every safe home wiring system should equal or exceed the requirements of the National Electrical Code. These panels have a main built-in breaker that can shut off all the power to your property. This course introduces Kirchhoff's voltage and current laws and explains how to use these laws to calculate the voltage and current of circuits.
