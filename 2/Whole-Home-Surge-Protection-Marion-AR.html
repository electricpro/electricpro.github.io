When connected to your home's circuit-breaker panel with a transfer switch, they can power almost as much as a home standby generator.</p>
<p>The consumer unit also protects the house's electrical appliances (and eventually you) by having incorporated within it either fuses or circuit breakers which automatically break the circuit if a fault occurs. The 5th step is to wire the lights. As the name suggests, surge protectors are there to protect electronics from blasts of electricity. A low-voltage wiring system in buildings may be used to operate line-voltage lights, receptacles, motors, or other devices.</p>

The more light fixtures on a single run of cable and the longer the cable, the greater the voltage drop. That said, most of us don't really know a whole lot about the electricity in our homes.
