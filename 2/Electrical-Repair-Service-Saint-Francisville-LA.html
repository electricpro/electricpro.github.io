Domestic & Commercial Emergency Electricians. In 1889, the business was incorporated as a private company known as General Electric Company Ltd. When connected to your home's circuit-breaker panel with a transfer switch, they can power almost as much as a home standby generator.</p>
<p>In an attempt to reduce the risk of electrocution and fires, the National Electrical Code requires specific types of outlets in certain locations. Most states require electricians to be licensed. Electrical upgrades are rarely simple. Just like your heating and cooling system is controlled by a thermostat, a Kohler generator is controlled by a transfer switch that senses when utility power fails, starting the generator automatically within seconds. This Champion Power Equipment whole house generator gets an edge over most others in its class from the fact that it provides a quieter and more residential-friendly operation with its 63 dB noise level.</p>
<p>A lightning bolt that directly strikes a power line in the vicinity of your home can easily over-power even the best consumer-grade surge protectors. This is perhaps not a project which you should do without help from an electrician, but if you have a permit, you can upgrade your power panel on your own. All the electrical circuits in your home are rated to handle a certain amount of electrical flow (amps). The detached service panel, screwdrivers, wire cutters, wire strippers, pliers, and more are items that can potentially touch parts of the service wires and transmit an electric shock to you.</p>
<p>But electricity is responsible for an average of 70 deaths and 350,000 serious injuries in the UK every year, so it's important you take steps to protect yourself and your loved ones from electrical dangers. To enable you to minimize the risk to your appliances and home equipment from possible power surges caused by sudden and unexpected increases in voltage fluctuation, GreyStone Power is offering our SurgeMaster Plus program.
