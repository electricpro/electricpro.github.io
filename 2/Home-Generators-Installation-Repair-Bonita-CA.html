<p>Like everything in life, it pays to be prepared in the event of an electrical emergency. While they may only seem like a minor nuisance when it comes time to plug in a new appliance with three prongs, these older outlets need to go. Outdated and inefficient, they lack the proper grounding plug newer outlets have, which means they're more likely to cause an electrical fire in your home. Excellent services, details of job explained clearly up front. The best way for me to install these is to have a 12V power supply in the basement (probably just a computer power supply) and pull 2-conductor cables up from there.</p>

Many switches, dimmers and outlets fit decora rocker switch plates which come in a huge variety of finishes. Worst of all, they install different voltages than intended for the system or for the individual wire runs or circuits. An electrician earning a state license means that they have trained a certain number of hours, knows the state codes and regulations, and takes safety seriously.</p>
