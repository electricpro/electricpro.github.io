<p>If that is the case, the switch leg of the circuit, from the switch to the outlet, may be white, and the yellow wire spliced to it in order not to have a white wire on the brass screws. On the other hand the FPE breaker does not turn power off by "tripping", allowing the circuit wiring to reach a combustible temperature which ignites the wires, outlet, and surrounding area. Scope of the project - The cost of your electrical panel replacement will vary based on what you need done.</p>
