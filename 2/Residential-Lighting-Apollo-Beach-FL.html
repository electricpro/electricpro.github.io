BEST ANSWER: I had initially started to just add more lights to an existing low voltage circuit. Regularly check appliance power cords and connections for wear, and don't use damaged cords. They can be used for a purely functional reason, like providing security or lighting pathways and entryways, or used for as a decorative piece for an outdoor area.</p>

<p>This 12 kW home standby generator can power a home up to 5,500 sq. ft. with a 4-ton air conditioner or other large or small appliances plugged on. It has a compact size, that makes it 50% smaller and 60% more quieter than previous 12 kW generators.

Don't forget to keep your appliances away from water, check for correct wattage light bulbs, and check the insulation on a cord. There is no point in time at which the light source ceases to function; instead, LEDs gradually degrade in performance over time. If you want to add more lights, you may need a bigger transformer; if so, it's probably more economical to buy a whole new system in a kit.</p>
