<h2>How To Hire Master Electrician Contractor in Adams</h2><p><img src="https://electricalimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/electrician.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>It is also possible that your home is of more recent construction and the switch has a neutral in the box as required by code, but is not connected to anything.
