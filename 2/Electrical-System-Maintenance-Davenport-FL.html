<p>If your electrical panel is very old and not designed to handle the electrical usage that is currently taking place, you may be facing a serious fire hazard.

Today's electronics, appliances, lighting and remodeling needs may leave your existing electrical service panel underpowered. To take a specialty journeyman electrician license test, trainees must have worked under the supervision of a licensed journeyman electrician or the appropriate specialty electrician for at approx.</p>
<p>Master Electrician: Must complete 2,000 hours as a licensed journeyman under a contracting master electrician. If you find yourself using power strips or extension cords in your home, then it's a strong sign that you are using more electricity than your home was designed for. Each lighting fixture is hardwired, with special attention paid to the concealment of unsightly wires, which are usually buried underground whenever possible. There will be three wires: one black, one white, and a separate ground wire that may be bare copper or is sometimes wrapped in green.</p>
