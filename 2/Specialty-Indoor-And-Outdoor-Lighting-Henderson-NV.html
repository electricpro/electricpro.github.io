Just as everyone's homes and electronic devices are different, do their need for surge protection will be different, but, ultimately, the more â€˜layers' of surge protection between a surge and your devices, the less likely they are to become damaged or destroyed. This is particularly true with a generator since the whole point is protecting your family during an already-stressful power outage.</p>
