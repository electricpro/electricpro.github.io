Just as everyone's homes and electronic devices are different, do their need for surge protection will be different, but, ultimately, the more ‘layers' of surge protection between a surge and your devices, the less likely they are to become damaged or destroyed. This is particularly true with a generator since the whole point is protecting your family during an already-stressful power outage.</p>
<p>Track lighting is a great, space-saving, versatile, and artistic way to illuminate your home or business. Below are some of the jobs that electrical contractors can provide residential customers.

The more power you use, and the longer runtime the generator needs to provide it, the more fuel you need.</p>
