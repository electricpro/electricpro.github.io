<h3>Electrical Panel Upgrade, Repair & Replacement Hampton VA 23666</h3>
<p>Portable gas engine generators cost between $300-$2,500 and provide from 2,500-10,000 watts of emergency power. Backup home generators are the only reliable protection against a power outage. The wiring's thickness determines the brightness of all of your landscape lights. There may be no tell-tale signs of bad wiring, overloads, or surge damage, making professional electrical inspections so important.
