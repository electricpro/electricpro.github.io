Safety Warning: Do not attempt to work on your electrical wiring, switches, or outlets unless you are properly trained and equipped to do so. Electrical components in a building can easily cause an electrical shock, burn, or even death.

<p>Whether you want to highlight a few features of your landscape or enhance the entire area, you can achieve your goals with landscape lighting.

Use 14 gauge wire for jobs totaling less than two hundred watts, and 12 gauge cable for systems that exceed 200 watts. Newer electrical codes require arc-fault circuit interrupter (AFCI) protection for all branch circuits supplying receptacles, switches, light fixtures, smoke detectors, etc., in essentially all locations in the dwelling except bathrooms, basement storage areas and garages.</p>
