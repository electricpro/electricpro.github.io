Do not talk on the phone, take a bath, or use electric appliances during a lightning storm. Standby generators also require regular maintenance which does not come cheap either. We provide end to end turnkey electrical services for our clients, which includes installation and maintenance of equipment's to ensure consistent power supply. Apprentice License: The State Electrical Commission registration is required.</p>
<p>They don't necessarily break down all at once and stop working, which is why they can cause warning signs ahead of time and notify you simply on its performance if it's indeed time to upgrade it. Luckily, here at Beacon Electrical Services, we can maintain and update your service panel. Even if your home does not have aluminum wiring, but it is an older home, you still may be at risk of electrical fire. You get the rugged Hands-On training panel loaded with the most common electrical devices that the student uses to actually wire up a real circuit using real tools and wire.</p>

A well-lit landscape can help you create a sense of comfort, security, and tranquility in your property. Staked outdoor solar yard lights can be placed closer to the ground and are the perfect choice for accent lighting that will be placed around or within a garden, whereas post mounted lights can easily mark driveways and pathways with ease.</p>
<p>So if you are replacing an older, existing switched outlet, and if it has 2-wire cable between the outlet and the switch, then the white wire is being used as either a permanent hot or as the switched power and IS NOT neutral. If your current line can hold 150-amps, you might want to consider that if your budget cannot handle nearly $5,000 for the upgrade to 200-amp service. The licensed electricians of MB Heating & Cooling help you determine the right size generator that is capable of powering you through a utility outage.</p>
