This applies especially to landlords, who would breach the law if the tenants' health is jeopardised by unlicensed electrical repairs.</p>
<p>New wiring, connection boxes, electrical panels and even lighting fixtures will all add to the project's cost.

For example, if your lights consume 100 watts of power, you'll need a power supply that's rated for at least 120 watts (100 x 1.2).

Fortunately, with the help of an emergency electrician, you can get back to normal quickly. Completely wireless and battery powered, Generac's Wireless Monitor provides you with instant status information without ever leaving the house.</p>
<p>Specifically these are hard wired lights, not merely lamps plugged into outlets.
