<p>For your own safety, always unplug a lamp when you change the light bulb. Sometimes, it makes more sense to replace your panel rather than repair it.

When wiring landscape lights, determining voltage drop is very important so you don't have dim lights at the end of your run. Most of the time, you don't think much about your breaker panel.

This course is designed to familiarize participants with the use of basic troubleshooting procedures to troubleshoot problems in electrical circuits. Unplug unused appliances and stow cords safely out of reach of pets, young children or hazardous situations. Turn the power back on at the circuit breaker.

<p>Issues typically present themselves in a variety of ways, including regular popping of breakers, electrical outlets that only work occasionally, and breaker panels that are a discombobulated mess. While the contacts are separating, any electrical energy stored in the inductance of the circuit being disconnected is dissipated as an arc within the switch, prolonging the transition and worsening the heating effect on the contacts. Since we started, First Choice Electrical LLC's number one goal has always been to provide superior customer service to residential clients.</p>
