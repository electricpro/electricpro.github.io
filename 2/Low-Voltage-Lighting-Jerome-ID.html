<p>The inspection will help identify potential sources of electrical fires, ensuring you make the changes needed to keep your home safe.

Sometimes it is necessary to disconnect a circuit at various points to take a voltage or resistance reading (resistance readings must be taken with the circuit de-energized).</p>
<p>We will help you to decide on whether you should have your outdated fuse panel replaced with a modern Circuit Breaker panel. While they are very different to the typical home consumer, a fuse box serves the same role of a circuit breaker in a building: to prevent the overloading of circuits by cutting off the flow of power and reducing risk of fire.
