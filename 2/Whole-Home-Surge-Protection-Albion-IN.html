<p>Illuminate a pathway with large-scale lanterns, use LED landscape lighting to illuminate trees and bushes, and make use of low voltage landscape lighting to light up an outdoor seating area. Electrical wiring is a job that should be left to professionals. Except for the transformer that is connected to the 120v circuit, all the fixtures run on harmless 12v current. This National Electrical Safety Month (NESM), the Electrical Safety Foundation International (ESFI) is increasing public awareness of electrical hazards in both the home and in the workplace with its Be in the Know about the New” NESM consumer awareness campaign and the newly released How Do You Know?” workplace safety awareness program.</p>

In wet conditions, this voltage must be limited to 15 volts for a sinusoidal ac and 21.2 volts peak for a non-sinusoidal ac. Since the body's resistance is decreased by water, the permissible voltage of the output of the low-voltage system is decreased accordingly to ensure safe handling and operation of these circuits where water is a concern.</p>
