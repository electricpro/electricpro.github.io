<p>From high-capacity electrical requirements to the demanding needs of 5-star resorts, Tri-City has demonstrated a standard of performance that has positioned the company as the state's leading electrical contractor. This might seem like a no-brainer, but you'd be shocked by how many businesses get burned by non-licensed commercial electricians. At IEC, our mission is to provide your apprentices, journeymen and management with education, training and forums so you can build a team of professionals and excel in the electrical construction industry.</p>

Please take note that every wiring system you connected has its own fuse and circuit breakers. Anyone who holds a license or registration with the State of South Dakota must have the required continuing education hours in order to renew his or her license or registration. If all else fails, wires that attach to the outlet are loose or the outlet itself has failed.</p>

Unlike standard lightbulbs, recessed lighting bulbs are concealed within the wall or ceiling, creating a pleasant lighting effect without being noticeable. LED lights are also flexible.
