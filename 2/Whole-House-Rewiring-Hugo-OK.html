<p>If the same thing occurred with a three-pronged outlet and you plugged something (with three prongs) into the outlet, the ground wire would absorb the shock and take the current into the ground where it can be safely neutralized. You have now installed a new electrical outlet and can take advantage of the safety and convenience of relocating your power needs. Circuit breakers keep tripping: This is an indication your electrical panel may be wearing down and should be replaced.</p>
<p>Non-fusable safety switch required on outdoor installations, and high-voltage indoor applications such as 90 amp tankless electric water heater where breaker box not in plain sight of equipment. Some surge protection devices give warnings when they can't function properly, but many don't. Please note: All electrical contractor's licenses expire on December 31st. TESCO's warranty, should a TESCO device receive a surge and fail to protect your equipment; direct lightning strikes excluded.</p>
