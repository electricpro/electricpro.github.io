The downside is you have to run extension cords everywhere you want power and you're limited to how many things you can plug in at once (most generators have either two or four outlets).</p>

Luckily, here at Beacon Electrical Services, we can maintain and update your service panel. Even if your home does not have aluminum wiring, but it is an older home, you still may be at risk of electrical fire.
