<h3>Pressing Need for Lightning Protection Installation in Hamilton AL</h3>
<p>The method you choose will depend on the type of fixtures, the distance from the transformer, and the type and size of wire. Now no surge protector will protect a system from the millions of volts created by a direct hit from lightning but a good protector will safeguard your system from most ordinary day-to-day power problems. We can help you to reduce your utility expenses by installing energy efficient lights or solar lamps. Of course, t is essential that you have proper lighting during the night, especially in outdoor spaces and pathways.</p>
<p>Shown in this wiring diagram is the power from the circuit breaker panel going to an electrical receptacle outlet and then continues to the next outlet and then to a single pole wall switch and then to another outlet. I just wire nutted the Black wires at the switch and used red for the hot to the switch (and then the switched side of the outlet) and black then at first outlet for always hot side. We create quality, long lasting, energy efficient , lighting schemes, and extreme outdoor lighting designs.</p>

Sometimes it is necessary to disconnect a circuit at various points to take a voltage or resistance reading (resistance readings must be taken with the circuit de-energized).</p>
<p>While our technicians specialize in Generac, we are able to provide regular generator maintenance services to any make or model generator. The best way to prevent damage during from lightning storm is to unplug devices that could be irreparably damaged. All installations were done at the designated times. Our electricians can work with any make of surge protection.
