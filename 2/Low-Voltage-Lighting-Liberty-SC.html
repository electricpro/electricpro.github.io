Safety Warning: Do not attempt to work on your electrical wiring, switches, or outlets unless you are properly trained and equipped to do so. Electrical components in a building can easily cause an electrical shock, burn, or even death. For the rest of the weeks that you need power, you can deduct the 3500 dollars for the cost of the generators but that still leaves you with a $350 bill per week to operate them.</p>

Once you check that everything is working, bury the extra wire, secure the lights, and do any final adjustments to make sure everything looks good.</p>
