<p>A: When contracting with the public and requesting permits, your business must be licensed as an electrical contractor. While most people are fine using the breaker panel that came with the home, other times problems arise and suggest an upgrade is in order. Electrical and fire safety officials warn that one misconnected wire can be deadly. Generac standby systems run an average $1,900 for a 7kW unit. Master - If you have not completed an approved apprenticeship program, you must show proof of six years of full-time experience supervised by a licensed master electrician.</p>
<p>If you travel a lot, consider a small, single-outlet surge protector that can help protect your laptop, phone and other devices that you take on the road. The availability of makes, types and models can be a little intimidating without having a basic understanding of which appliances you want your backup power source to operate effectively. When it comes to electronic devices everyone wants their investments to be protected. According to the NEC , GFCIs are required in bathrooms, kitchens, basements, and garages; and AFCIs are required in many parts of the home and sometimes the entire home, depending on the state you live in.
