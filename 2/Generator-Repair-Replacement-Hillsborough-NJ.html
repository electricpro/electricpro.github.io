How to Become One : Most electricians learn through an apprenticeship, but some start out by attending a technical school. It actually sounds like this is the problem; confusion over what color goes where in those wires from the switch. The hot source wire is removed from the receptacle and spliced to the red wire running to the switch.</p>
<p>In addition to electric-specific licenses, several states require electrical contractors to obtain a generic contractor license.
