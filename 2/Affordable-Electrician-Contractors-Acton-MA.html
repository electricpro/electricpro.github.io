<p>It is important to repair or replace old or damaged electrical wiring before it becomes a hazard. Extension cords are intended for temporary use. Because having a grounding wire and grounded (three-pronged) outlets adds an extra level of safety, newer houses and buildings are required to have three-pronged outlets with grounding wires. I do not suggest that you remove the breaker panel cover which will show all the wiring from the circuits, but you could turn the breaker off to a room and remove the cover plates to the light switches and receptacles and loosen the screws that hold them in the electrical box.</p>

<p>Then reconnect the motor starter coil, overload circuit and field wiring, restore incoming power and start the motor. Some of the switches are doubled or tripled together because they power appliances that require large electricity loads, such as air conditioners and electric dryers. When you turn the switch off, it interrupts the electricity that flows through the black wire from the power source to the fixture. There are many different light installations that can help enhance the visibility and aesthetics of any room in your house.</p>
