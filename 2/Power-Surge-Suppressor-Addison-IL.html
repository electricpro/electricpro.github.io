Surge protection should be layered in the house to be at both the electrical service to protect the whole home and at the point of use to protect sensitive electronics. On the other hand, from an electrician's perspective, the two main phases of construction include phase one - the rough in, and phase two - the finish.</p>
<p>Important thing to remember - if you decide to install GFCI receptacle in a place of the existing electrical outlet, you should perform this installation following your current local jurisdiction requirements - this might not be entirely the latest NEC (National Electrical Code) but should be very close to it - find out required GFCI locations based on the latest NEC.

<p>Perhaps you've rearranged your furniture and realized that you need more lighting in a certain area of a room, or you may need more lights in a naturally dark space like a garage or basement. Surge protectors prevent that from happening. To use a portable generator without the hassle of running extension cords, hire an electrician to install a manual transfer switch subpanel off your main circuit panel and install a dedicated inlet to power the subpanel (installing the subpanel is complex; not a DIY project).</p>
<p>If you notice a burning smell or see any burn marks near circuit breakers, there is a good chance there was a small fire. Landscape design and lighting is no exception to this.
