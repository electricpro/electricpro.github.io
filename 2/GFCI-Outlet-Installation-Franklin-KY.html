With all of the wires reconnected and your new wire in place, carefully tuck the wires back into the electrical box. Always use ladders made with non-conductive side rails (e.g., fibreglass) when working with or near electricity or power lines.</p>
<p>A good electrician will be able to install a quality home surge protector into your panel. Its size makes it perfect for small and medium-sized homes and it monitors when it's close to overloading so it can stop power supply to unimportant circuits to keep the vital appliances running.
