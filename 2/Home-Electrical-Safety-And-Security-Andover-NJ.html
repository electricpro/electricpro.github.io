<p>Standby generators also have solid steel or aluminum enclosures, good mufflers to reduce noise, and be compliant with all relevant emissions regulations. Your home will lose power during part of the process, but a good electrician will know how to minimize this time. If an appliance falls into a filled tub or sink, or if you touch an electrical appliance with wet hands or while standing in water, you risk severe electrical shock and possibly death. Most generators run on natural gas so they are able to keep working during a power outage.</p>
<p>Most outdoor lighting systems use low voltage lighting which is employs 12 volts of electrical devices instead of the usual 120 volts that are used at home or in offices.
