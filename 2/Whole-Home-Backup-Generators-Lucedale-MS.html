When mounting a light switch over a countertop—for example, in an indoor or outdoor kitchen, an art studio, or a craft room—reduce the standard wall mounting height to 40 inches. Narrow beamed lighting that highlights sharp features and wide angled flood lighting to pick up flat surfaces are preferred.</p>
