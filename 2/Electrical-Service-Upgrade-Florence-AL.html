<p>About the only electrical code restriction for a low voltage system is that the transformer be connected to a GFCI protected receptacle or circuit, when installed in locations that require GFCI protection (see Common GFCI Location Requirements ). When it comes to household electricity, there's a lot more to consider than simply turning a switch On and Off. This applies especially to landlords, who would breach the law if the tenants' health is jeopardised by unlicensed electrical repairs.</p>
<p>This type of generator is installed permanently at your home (typically in the yard) and is connected directly to the electrical panel of your home. Our surge protection devices (SPDs) and modules are designed to provide protection from transient overvoltage. Make sure all electrical outlets are three-hole, grounded outlets. Similarly, electrical appliances should never be handled with wet hands as this heightens the chance of getting an electric shock.
