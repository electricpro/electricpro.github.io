<h3>New Construction Electrical Design & Installation in Marquette MI</h3>
<p>It is best, then, to have a professional install these low voltage landscape lights to minimize the risk of physical equipment damage. When installing dimmers or smart dimmers, avoid CFL bulbs as they are not compatible with a lot of dimmers even though the bulbs say "dimmable." Smart light switches fall in the middle of the cost range, being less expensive than a fleet of individual bulbs and a bit pricier than smart plugs. 120 volt systems must maintain absolute moisture free which is difficult with the wires running underground.</p>
<p>The panel uses the sun to charge a battery on the lamp, eliminating the need for electrical wires and a transformer. These types of warning signs could be the start of something a lot more damaging, like an electrical fire or other safety hazards that can affect you and your family. Please note: Surge protection equipment will not protect you or your home against a direct lightning strike. Our team can install and repair most types of outlets and switches, and we stand behind our work with a money-back guarantee.</p>
<p>Our outdoor lighting contractors place your lights against a surface with the beams pointed up. This creates a shadow that illuminates the wall's or stone work's texture. The bare copper wire that is nearly black was a clue in tracking down a neutral and ground wiring failure at this building. Our lighting contractors are licensed, bonded and extremely professional. Group and label the wires in the switch boxes so you'll know how to connect them after the drywall is complete.</p>
<p>This course is designed to familiarize participants with basic concepts associated with the operation of transformers, circuit breakers, and various types of switches. The best way to purchase multiple low voltage lights is by buying a kit. We are equipped with a full service ladder truck and an 85' crane for outdoor lighting and signage repairs, as well as billboard construction. If you clipped the little tab and ran the two different whites to the two screws you're fine.</p>
