The board reviews the experience of out-of state applicants to determine if they meet the experience requirements or an equivalent of the experience requirements. This isn't too surprising, as being an electrician often means crouching, kneeling and bending to reach the electrical installations you're supposed to be working on. With that in mind, it is advised that you take the proper precautions to ensure that your body remains healthy: electricians should stretch often and consider investing in knee pads to wear while working.</p>
