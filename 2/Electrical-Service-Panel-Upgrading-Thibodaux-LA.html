The hot source wire is removed from the receptacle and spliced to the red wire running to the switch.</p>
<p>Wolf electricians have the expertise and experience needed to review your current panel and provide you with the best upgrade plan for your home and requirements. Electrical Contractor License: The Department of Community and Economic Development registration is required. Turn off all electrical appliances when you go out.
