Reading blueprints, or technical diagrams of a work site's electrical wiring.

<p>Standby generators also have solid steel or aluminum enclosures, good mufflers to reduce noise, and be compliant with all relevant emissions regulations. Your home will lose power during part of the process, but a good electrician will know how to minimize this time.

Most generators run on natural gas so they are able to keep working during a power outage.</p>
