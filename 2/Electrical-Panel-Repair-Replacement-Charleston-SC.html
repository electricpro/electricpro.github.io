Sterlite Power (as a division of STL) was awarded India's first Independent Power Transmission Project under Tariff Based Competitive Bidding (TBCB) regime. As such, landscape lighting fixtures are best hidden within bushes or rock formations and properly oriented to highlight the leaves in a tall tree or wash up a textural wall.
