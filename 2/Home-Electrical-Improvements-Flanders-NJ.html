The bare ground wire—if there is one— is connected to the green grounding screw on the switch. Use a noncontact voltage tester like this to double-check that all wires in a box are dead” after turning off the circuit breaker. Be sure to use ‘earthed' switches and check the electrical load on the switch.</p>
<p>Turn the power off at the circuit breaker. If you find yourself using extension cords very often, consider having an electrician install new outlets throughout your home. What this rating means is that it can handle greater surges than devices with a lower In rating. Turn the power back OFF at the service panel, carefully remove the receptacle from the electrical box, mark pairs of wires LOAD & LINE, or LINE & SWITCH LEG and remove the remaining wires from the receptacle.</p>
