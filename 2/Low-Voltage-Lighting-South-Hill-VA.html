<p>Commercial electrical contractors don't often like taking residential rewiring jobs and often charge a premium to do so. The circuits in many older electrical systems don't trip, even when overloaded, which poses a great risk to your home.

Our Linwood, Northfield, and Egg Harbor Township NJ area team has years of experience installing all different kinds of lighting.</p>

Adding an electrical outlet next to an existing light switch is easy, as long as there is a neutral wire in the box.</p>
