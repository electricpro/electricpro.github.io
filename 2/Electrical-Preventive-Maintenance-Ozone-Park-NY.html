<p>3. Whole-House protection - This is what I had mentioned above. While it is true that most people can safely re-wire a plug and there is no need to call an electrician for that one, any tasks more complicated than that, including fitting replacement switches; would be better left to the professional unless you know exactly what you are doing.
