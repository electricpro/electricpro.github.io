The voltage drop in the main power wires from the generation source or the battery to the bus should not exceed 2 percent of the regulated voltage, when the generator is carrying rated current or the battery is being discharged at the 5-minute rate.</p>

Despite this lengthy life span, building owners are obligated to perform routine maintenance and testing to ensure their egress lighting systems are fully functional when an emergency arises. This will allow the switch or outlet to be mounted flush with the wall which will make it easier to use. Attach the wire to each light fixture; many low voltage light fixtures use quick connectors to make this process simple.</p>
