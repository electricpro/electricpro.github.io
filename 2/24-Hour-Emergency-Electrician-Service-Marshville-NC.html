<p>Most electricians will be upfront about what they think needs to be done concerning your electrical wiring. Home electrical wire systems are complicated. If there is an ‘earth' terminal on the back of the switch, connect the ‘earth' wire to its terminal as well as connecting to the ‘earth' terminal on the back box. If you can prioritize what you want to run during an outage, and use that knowledge to get by with a smaller generator, not only do you save on the initial cost, but when you look at fuel costs like pochax shared, you can see a pretty decent fuel cost savings, as well as need less storage.</p>
