<p>After you have approved your design plan, we'll begin the outdoor installation process. A. For basic generator installations we install a power inlet for your portable generator to plug into during a power outage. The fixtures are designed to withstand moisture, but calcium and lime deposits; hard water scale and dirt will build up on the lenses, dramatically reducing the light output. Not only can preventive electrical maintenance save businesses time and money, but by keeping equipment functioning properly, the risk of hazard is greatly reduced and the work environment becomes a safer place.</p>
<p>Our electrical experts can go over all your options so that you make an informed decision about a new backup generator for your home.
