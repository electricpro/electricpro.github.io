<h3>Standby Generator Installation & Repair Services Eatonton GA 31024</h3>
<p>As a homeowner, it's wise to know where the breaker panel in your house is located in the case of an emergency or the sudden need to cut off or restore power. Since Georgia is faced with a substantial amount of thunderstorms each year, surge protection is a concern for every Georgia homeowner and consumer. Too few switches, outlets and lights. Either way, the only method of making it a half hot - half switched and half unswitched - is to run another wire to it. Relocate cords instead of overloading outlets.</p>
<p>It's often referred to as the main breaker box or fuse box. Right before and immediately after the storm, people tend to purchase portable generators; once the debris has cleared, many purchase standby‚Äù generators, which are more powerful than portable generators (and more expensive) and are installed in the home. Whether you need help installing a light switch, wiring an outlet or running a wire to a new lighting fixture, the Handy platform will connect you with the right electrical service professional with the right experience.</p>
