<p>Employ only a certified electrician with training and experience in safety practices and procedures, as well as the proper equipment, to perform all major electrical installation or repair.

<p>In other words - don't continue using an aging, defective electrical panel or cuicut breaker in your home. With your new switches connected, carefully push everything back into the electrical boxes. Or maybe it's something bad, like a new electrical contractor opened up in your town and hired away some of your best people. Don't run extension cords under the rug or carpet. Electricians train to handle a wide variety of issues with electrical power, lighting and control systems.</p>
<p>Keep cords away from sources of heat and water. You can't just plug in the TV — there's the TV and the receiver and the Roku and whatever else.” The group resorted to plugging power strips and extension cords into virtually every outlet.
