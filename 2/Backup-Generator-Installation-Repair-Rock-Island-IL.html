<h3>Electrical Installation Services in Rock Island IL</h3>
<p>Electricians know the ins and outs of designing lighting systems, installing street lights and intercom systems, ensuring electrical work is up to code and repairing electrical wiring. Most modern appliances could easily overload an outdated electrical panel, which could cause issues for your home. A certified service provider for GE and Generac Generators, we ensure your backup generator is properly installed and maintained year after year. The alternative was aluminum wiring which was plentiful and cheap, but the potential danger it posed was not recognized at the time.</p>
