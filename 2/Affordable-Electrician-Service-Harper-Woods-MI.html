<p>Both outlets of the same receptacle are controlled by the existing light switch. If you're having circuit and panel capacity issues, we offer FREE in-home estimates by licensed electricians so you can be sure your home will remain safe. The transformer is where the power gets converted from line voltage to low voltage and needs to be installed somewhere nearby.

<p>By purchasing the proper outlet surge protector you are taking a preventive measure that can save you thousands, not only in terms of equipment but in data as well. It's not a huge deal if you mix them up, as it will simply switch to the bottom receptacle being the switched one—you can always switch them back. Be careful not to dislodge any wires from the switch terminals - the wires should still be firmly attached to the screws on the switch holding them in place.</p>
<p>If these surges are strong enough, they can damage your computer and other electronic equipment, sometimes irreparably. Our electricians will also clean up after themselves once the job is done, leaving the place as clean as when they arrived. 13. Fees for services, feeders and circuits operating at over 250 volts shall be double those listed in items 2 and 3 above.

Also, keeping the surge protectors close to the outlet will help prevent tripping over them or otherwise damaging them.</p>
<p>Standby generators permanently connect to your home's or business's electrical system. Some stranded aluminum wiring is still used in houses today for the main service entry wires and other 240 volt circuits like ranges and clothes dryers. Every generator has a fuel source that it's powered by. Unless you are using a wind generator, you will most likely have to store fuel in preparation for power outages. Tip: Don't bury the cable more than 3 inches or you'll have difficulty connecting the light fixture.</p>
