Some common sense safety precautions include making sure your hands are dry and not standing in water when performing electrical work or when accessing your electrical panel. We want all our customers to stay safe when using electricity, whether at your home, farm or office. We don't have a qualified or licensed electrician in our company hence I'm trying to get mine so i can do installation as well.</p>

At All Seasons Air Conditioning & Heating, we offer comprehensive electrical services you can count on to keep your home running at peak efficiency.
