Fearing long power outages—plus a refrigerator full of spoiled food and a flooded basement—more and more storm-weary Americans are purchasing home generators. They can be used on ordinary combustibles(A), gas or oil(B) fires ,which are common in the kitchen or garage, or electrical(C) fires.</p>

Pull the plug, not the cord, when disconnecting an electrical device. This flaw can lead to damage to the panel, breakers and home electrical devices, or cause a fire. This can't be understated, it is important to make sure your new generator is installed properly to keep your home appliances working properly and the new generator to last a long time.</p>
