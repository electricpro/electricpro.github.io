<p>Cloth wiring is another very tricky topic for a lot of home inspectors, electricians, and insurance companies. Low-voltage transformers need an outlet that connects with your home's electrical system. Diesel powered generators are more durable and have a higher fuel efficiency.

Joe 'Connell Electrical Contracting has extensive experience in servicing all electrical needs associated with knob and tube wiring and would be happy to assist you as needed.</p>
<p>To prepare for major storms and power failures, invest in a home generator that will automatically provide power in those critical times.

There are many projects you can take on at home without any professional assistance, but electrical wiring is not recommended for those who've never done it before.</p>
