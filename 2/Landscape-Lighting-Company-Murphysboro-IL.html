On the other hand, if you want your house to remain lit even during a power outage, you can opt for a small sized generator. PRECO offers surge protection (PDF) to members to help stop indirect surges that could damage or destroy household wiring and large appliances such as air conditioning and refrigeration equipment. A computer system stands to lose gobs of important data in the 10 to 20 seconds between the time the power goes out and the generator starts pumping electricity.</p>
<p>You can pull on the wires in the wire nut and if it doesn't come off, it is ready to go. Install that dimmer back into the box and put your cover plate back on and now you will have control over your for some reason you go down stairs, and you turn your circuit breaker back on and you come upstairs test the outlet you have just installed and it doesn't work, what you want to do is go back and double check your terminals and make sure the wires that you have installed are tight and in the proper location, and if there are any other wires or wire nuts in that box check them to make sure they are tight, once you have double checked all your connections, you can turn your circuit breaker back on and check you outlet, you should be fine.</p>

Thankfully, it wasn't anything more serious, but it woke you up about electrical safety.</p>

Rowell's Services offers several options for whole-home surge protection, and we can help you determine which is best suited to your home.
