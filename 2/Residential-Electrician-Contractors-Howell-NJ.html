We may think we are aware of all the mishaps and dangers associated with electrical devices, but there are essential electrical safety tips that you must observe.</p>

When you turn the system if you find the lighting to be very dim, the cause is probably due to a transformer that is not able to supply enough power.</p>

Some surge protectors come with warranties, which may be helpful in the event your stuff is damaged.
