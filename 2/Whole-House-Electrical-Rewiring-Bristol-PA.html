<p>It covers essential circuits or whole house coverage, and produces clean power for sensitive electronics and appliances. Even a little rain can damage a generator, and you'll end up spending a lot of money to fix it. If you have a standby generator outside the home, you'll want to build a small enclosure around it. If you have a portable generator, which you can move in or out of a garage or some other covered location, you probably just need a cover. Since generators are used in case of emergencies, it's vital that they are installed correctly and are poised to work efficiently.</p>
<p>Moisture can wreak havoc on a home's electrical system and this generally shows at the panels. It is perfectly acceptable to change colors throughout your home, for example satin nickel switches with stainless steel plates in a kitchen, bright red switches on a dramatic accent wall, black outlets in a bathroom with black marble counters or tiling, or pleasing almond electrical wiring devices in a bedroom. Security lighting systems should provide bright light and motion sensors, in consideration of a homeowners' lifestyle.</p>

Unlike portable generators, there are no smelly by-products of kerosene or gasoline.</p>
