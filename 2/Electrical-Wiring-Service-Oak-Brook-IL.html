<p>Parallel wiring is the standard for 120 volt circuits in the entire house, making possible the independent use of all appliances, supplied by the same voltage. That is why it is said that electricity is always looking for a path to ground (lower potential). Reach out to the professionals at All Seasons Air Conditioning & Heating to learn more about our comprehensive electrical services and how they can help your home run more efficiently. The source for the circuit is at the switch and 2-wire cable runs to each receptacle outlet.</p>
<p>Limited - If you have not completed an approved apprenticeship program, you must show three years of experience supervised by a licensed master or limited electrician. Simply put, this method allows easy troubleshooting and insures proper distribution of power across all lighting fixtures.
