<p>It is also possible that your home is of more recent construction and the switch has a neutral in the box as required by code, but is not connected to anything. The white wire is commonly used as the LINE down to the switch and must be re-indentified with a different color to indicate that. Or you could remove the wires from the switch and tie those two together, bypassing the switch. Refueling-If your generator runs on gas, this step won't apply to you because the gas is sourced from an outside pipe.</p>
<p>Federal Pacific circuit breaker panels, with their faulty Stab-Lok breakers, still lurk in many older homes, says Volpe who replaces at least 300 each year.
