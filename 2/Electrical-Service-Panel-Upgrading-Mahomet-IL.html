If the main fuses remain as they are, the supplies and installation are fairly simple. Kitchens, bathrooms, bedrooms, and hallways are just a few spaces that can benefit from low voltage lighting options.

<p>Applicants may substitute education in electrical curriculum for up to 1 year of the required 4 years of experience. Excessive voltage drop is critical to the proper operation of the luminaires and the length of run may require larger wire than 12 AWG to ensure proper voltage to the lighting units. Homes built in recent years can, therefore, accommodate 220-volt circuits as well, which can be distinguished in the circuit box because the switches they use are twice the size of those for 110-volt circuits.</p>
