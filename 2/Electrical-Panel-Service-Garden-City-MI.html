<p>Unfortunately, you do not have the wire necessary in the box to make a half hot - the permanent hot is missing and only the switched hot is available. True Power Technology is also a key highlight like with many other Generac generators, and it delivers top-notch power with less than 5% THD to run sensitive appliances and electronics safely and smoothly.

Because a light switch is indeed switching a hot wire to the light, you've got power at the switch location.</p>
