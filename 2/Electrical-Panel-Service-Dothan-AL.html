<p>And, no one knows generators better than Diamond Electric. Your regular surge protectors are useless in this case and if you have any electrical devices plugged in, they're going to be toast in a split second. Especially if the new electric panel is physically larger than the one being replaced, the original wires may not reach the circuit breakers in the new panel. Electrical service panels have components inside them that are designed to fail: fuses or circuit breakers.</p>
<p>In order to know the gauge of the wire and the circuit information, you'll have to check the cable-sheath labeling. Watch out: if the "hot" wire in your light switch is on a 3-way circuit you may not always have power at your add-on receptacle.
