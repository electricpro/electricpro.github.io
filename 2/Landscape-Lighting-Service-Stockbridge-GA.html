<p>Extension cords are for temporary use.

<h3>The Benefits of Hiring a Stockbridge GA Commercial Electrical Contractor</h3>
<p>No matter how great your surge protection is, if lightening strikes your house, all bets are off. According to the National Institute for Burn Medicine, more than half of all burn accidents involving infants and children can be prevented by lower water heater settings. The best solution is to put all three white wires, plus an additional one about 6" long, into a wire nut. We are a fully accredited and certified company that performs the necessary electrical work.</p>
<p>A common problem is a switch that does nothing or an electrical outlet that is not functional. Experience: Typically, a residential electrician uses single phase power supplies - 120 or 240 volts. Lay the wires alongside the lights - but do not attach yet. The BLS reports that jobs for electrical contractors are expected to increase 23 percent between 2010 and 2020. Although circuit breakers and electrical panels are safer and more reliable than fuse boxes, they are still prone to problems now and again.</p>
<p>It is a good idea to speak to your electrical professional about layering the whole-house surge protection, especially if there's an elaborate home entertainment system or other expensive electronic set-up. Just happened to come across this article while looking for some other information of landscape lighting and was drawn in by the clever website name (always good to be handy!) but wanted to point out a couple of small changes that can make a HUGE difference in how long your install will continue to work perfectly, or work at all.</p>
<p>Typically, new circuit breakers and new feed copper wire are some cases we will also change the meter base to allow the power company to install larger feeder wires. Use 14-gauge cable for lighting systems that total 200 watts or less and 12-gauge cable for systems that are more than 200 watts. A specialized engineering analysis may be needed to provide sufficient protection, especially in situations of high lightning risk. Practicality-wise, if a device is able to handle the usual fluctuations in power supply and current flow, you don't need to hook it up to a surge protector.</p>
