<p>Circular saws, drills, power sanders, and other electrically powered tools can deliver nasty shocks or burns Protect yourself by practicing proper electrical safety: Periodically inspect the cords and plugs on all power tools or extension cords, and avoid using any tool if the cord shows signs of fraying, nicks, cuts, cracks, or burns. LED or Halogen Systems: As with everything else in lighting, the market is quickly going to LED.

<p>Each 120-volt circuit has a black or color wire connected to a circuit breaker or fuse; the white wire is connected to the neutral bus bar. For outdoor lights, it is best to choose one that has low wattage to save energy and to avoid lights that are too bright that make your garden look garish and tacky. When you shop for surge protection, you are quickly going to notice that there are many out there to choose from. Keep all surge protectors away from moisture of any kind.</p>
<p>Most outdoor lighting systems use low voltage lighting which is employs 12 volts of electrical devices instead of the usual 120 volts that are used at home or in offices.
