A certified service provider for GE and Generac Generators, we ensure your backup generator is properly installed and maintained year after year. The alternative was aluminum wiring which was plentiful and cheap, but the potential danger it posed was not recognized at the time.</p>
<p>So, the first rule here is not to use electrical appliances when the ground is wet. Also think about adding outlets inside bathroom drawers and cabinets to plug in devices like electric toothbrushes, razors, and blow dryers. Call us at (509) 362-9556 to discuss your indoor and outdoor lighting.
