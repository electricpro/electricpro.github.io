<h2>How To Hire Residential Electrician Contractor in Waipahu</h2><p><img src="https://electricalimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/electrician.jpg" alt=""><p>

And just as before, the neutral wire connects to the silver screw and the ground wire to the green screw.

The most common type of electrical injury for pets is electrocution from chewing on an electrical cord.</p>
