<p>Power generators have two main components. If they look OK, then you'd use your DMM to see if there's power to them, and, of course, on the motor side of each one. Maintain your whole house generator regularly by having a scheduled maintenance routine to ensure it lasts long enough. To maintain proper polarity when wiring a receptacle, connect the black hot wire to one of the hot bronze-colored terminals. Add a few feet for each fixture so you have some slack and the ability to relocate the fixtures slightly.</p>
<p>Finally, the receptacle manufacturer provides a ground screw on the receptacle that is intended to be connected by copper wire to a ground wire, parts and codes being ignored if you try using the box and its wire as the ground path.
