<p>Plated copper wire tinned copper wire is relatively common in older homes, and it looks like aluminum wire. Check that extension cords are correctly rated for the amount of electricity they are to carry and are Underwriter Laboratory (UL) approved. It is also responsible for switching the lights off when the room is empty and turn these on upon sensing the presence of an occupant. A rare, but destructive cause of power surges is lightning, but when it strikes, you'll wish you had surge protection.</p>
<p>Legitimate licensing: If your state requires electricians to be licensed, check that the license is current. The technical skills of engineers and technical managers as far as the operation, maintenance and troubleshooting of such important industrial equipment are vital for the efficient and cost effective operation of the plant with minimum downturn.

<p>The licensed electricians at Stack Electric want to pass along some general electrical safety tips to make sure all of our customers are "playing safe" around electrical equipment and wiring.

After a major power outage, they sent their service team in a snowstorm to service the generator and ensure it would keep us going throughout the snowstorm. Handy electrical contractors are used to working on jobs of all sizes. By catching such problems early, electrical maintenance helps reduce unexpected power outages and protects equipment from damage.</p>
<p>If you calculate a number higher than your current service panel, an upgrade is in order. This is the amount of current that is allowed to pass through to electronic devices after the damaging currents have been diverted into the ground.
