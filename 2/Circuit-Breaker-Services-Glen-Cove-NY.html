How to Become One : Most electricians learn through an apprenticeship, but some start out by attending a technical school. It actually sounds like this is the problem; confusion over what color goes where in those wires from the switch. The hot source wire is removed from the receptacle and spliced to the red wire running to the switch.</p>
<p>Non-fusable safety switch required on outdoor installations, and high-voltage indoor applications such as 90 amp tankless electric water heater where breaker box not in plain sight of equipment. Some surge protection devices give warnings when they can't function properly, but many don't. Please note: All electrical contractor's licenses expire on December 31st.
