<p>Modern generators are more efficient than ever and can create an electrical output that can power your home.

NEC 411.4(2) does not permit low-voltage lighting systems within 10 feet of these areas, unless permitted by Article 680. With no wiring, installation is much cheaper than traditional lighting as no concrete or landscaping needs to be torn up and reset and there is no waiting for the utility company to connect the lights.</p>
<p>Unlike the silent portable units , a standby whole house generator is installed permanently on a concrete pad and connected directly to your home's electric box to provide uninterrupted power that can kick in automatically. Electrical panels are also referred to as breaker panel, electrical service, circuit breaker panel, distribution board, or panel board.

This can leave homeowners with electrical wiring that is not really suitable for the higher electrical needs we have today.</p>
<p>Important thing to remember - if you decide to install GFCI receptacle in a place of the existing electrical outlet, you should perform this installation following your current local jurisdiction requirements - this might not be entirely the latest NEC (National Electrical Code) but should be very close to it - find out required GFCI locations based on the latest NEC.
