When you call our 24-hour emergency electrical service, you will talk to a licensed electrician who will ask you a few questions about your residential problem and dispatch an emergency electrician as soon as possible.

<p>Like a car, an emergency standby generator is powered by internal combustion engine that can run nonstop for days at a time, so they require a considerable amount of maintenance. Electrical panels are one of those things that just work until they don't.
