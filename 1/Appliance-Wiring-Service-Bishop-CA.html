<p>Parking Lot Lighting - Parking lot lights are necessary for lighting and security. 5 common mistakes made while installing outdoor lighting.

<p>Never plug one surge protector into another surge protector or power strip. The lights have clamps with metal teeth that pierce the cable insulation and tap directly into the power line. If at the switch, you have power between black and ground but none between black and neutral the most probable answer is a disconnected white neutral somewhere.
