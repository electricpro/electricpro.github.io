Upon completion of this course, participants should have a basic understanding of electrical troubleshooting techniques used in industry.</p>
<p>Electrical Contractor - You must have held a supervisory or managerial position in commercial, industrial or residential electrical work.

When outlets are installed upside down, the ground prong is facing up, meaning it's nearly impossible to cause a spark in the event the plug pulls away from the wall.</p>
