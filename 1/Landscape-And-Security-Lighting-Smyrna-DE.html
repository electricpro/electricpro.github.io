<p>A common misconception many homeowners have is that they can protect their home from dangerous lightning strikes and voltage surges simply by plugging their TV or computer into a power strip or just installing a surge protective panel. Grounded circuits are safer than ungrounded circuits.

Upon completion of this course, participants should have a basic understanding of electrical troubleshooting techniques used in industry.</p>
<p>Electrical Contractor - You must have held a supervisory or managerial position in commercial, industrial or residential electrical work. Your electrical panel is one of the most important components of your electrical system. Have any extension cord that feels more than comfortably warm checked by an electrician. When outlets are installed upside down, the ground prong is facing up, meaning it's nearly impossible to cause a spark in the event the plug pulls away from the wall.</p>
<p>For good landscape lighting that is a feature of your garden, varying the types of lighting and their placement will add more aesthetic interest. Putting it into easily digestible words, a standby generator works with two major parts: it works with the generator itself and with a transfer switch.
