With smart light switches, you can ease the strain on your eyes by slowly bringing up the lights. This helps protect the equipment and can help prevent electric shock. Under Australian law, electrical work that involves fixed wiring is strictly regulated and must almost always be performed by a licensed electrician or electrical contractor.</p>

PLEASE don't use extension cords as a substitute for repairing or installing building wiring. Whether lighting a path or shedding light in a dark corner of a room, low-voltage lights are an inexpensive solution.</p>
