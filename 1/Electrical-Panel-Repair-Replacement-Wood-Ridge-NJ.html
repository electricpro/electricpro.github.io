<h2>How To Hire Residential Electrician Service in Wood Ridge</h2><p><img src="https://electricalimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/electrician.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Portable generators vary in price and size, so it is best to evaluate how you are going to be using your generator before purchasing it. Unlike whole-house generators, you have to manually add fuel to your portable generator before each use. Here in Lake and Porter Counties, where the threat of power outages is year-round, a whole-house generator can prove to be a good investment for your home or commercial property in Crown Point or the surrounding areas.</p>
<p>If you travel a lot, consider a small, single-outlet surge protector that can help protect your laptop, phone and other devices that you take on the road. The availability of makes, types and models can be a little intimidating without having a basic understanding of which appliances you want your backup power source to operate effectively. When it comes to electronic devices everyone wants their investments to be protected. According to the NEC , GFCIs are required in bathrooms, kitchens, basements, and garages; and AFCIs are required in many parts of the home and sometimes the entire home, depending on the state you live in. Check with your electrician to see if your home's electrical system is up-to-code.</p>

<p>Standby generators also have solid steel or aluminum enclosures, good mufflers to reduce noise, and be compliant with all relevant emissions regulations. Your home will lose power during part of the process, but a good electrician will know how to minimize this time. If an appliance falls into a filled tub or sink, or if you touch an electrical appliance with wet hands or while standing in water, you risk severe electrical shock and possibly death. Most generators run on natural gas so they are able to keep working during a power outage.</p>
