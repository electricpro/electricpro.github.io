Safety: Another essential advantage of having an outdoor lighting system is safety.</p>
<p>Bruss Landscaping specializes in carefully designing and installing exclusively LED low voltage outdoor lighting systems to enhance the landscapes we design. During an apprenticeship, trainee electricians must complete 144 hours per year of technical training, where they learn about blueprints, safety and first aid practices, electrical code requirements, mathematics, and electrical theory.
