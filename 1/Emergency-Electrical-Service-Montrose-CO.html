Do not buy a transformer with too much power, such as a 600-watt transformer for a 100-watt fixture installation.

<p>Landscape lighting design is very similar to the design of the landscape itself.

Avoid installing lights on top of railings or posts where they might shine in people's eyes and pose a safety hazard.

A new skylight that has been properly installed should not leak, even during a downpour. Our expert connects all the wires together and then runs short individual wires (pigtails) to the receptacle. It's safe to say that this unit is as reliable a backup power source as you could hope to get. Historically, landscape architects have specified the exterior lighting, but Luxury Illumination has become so adept at it that many of the architects default to Matthews and his team.</p>

These problems often arise when you least expect them to. Whether you're in need of electrical repair in the middle of the night, early in the morning, or on a weekend, Axberg is the company to call.

When you call Mr. Electric, we will inspect around your electrical panels if you have an older home and provide fuse box upgrades in Roswell if you need it.
