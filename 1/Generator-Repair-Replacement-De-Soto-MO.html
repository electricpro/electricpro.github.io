<h3>Lighting Fixture Installation & Repair De Soto MO 63020</h3>
<p>A power surge, which is also called transient voltage, is basically an increase in voltage that's above the normal level of electricity flow.

These lights are solar-powered and have an integrated light sensor so they turn on automatically at night and off when the sun comes up in the morning.</p>
