If the main fuses remain as they are, the supplies and installation are fairly simple. Kitchens, bathrooms, bedrooms, and hallways are just a few spaces that can benefit from low voltage lighting options. On a side note, a good rule of thumb is to never point light fixtures at your neighbor's windows. Read on to know about the types and specifications of surge protectors.</p>

Updating your control panel has no effect on the wiring, unless you want to increase the number of electric outlets to eliminate the need for adaptors and extension cords. Another option - the 12 Switch Panel for GE Switches - would allow the addition of three more lighting controls (or the unused openings could be filled with blank inserts). We would actually go as far as to claim we are the best emergency electricians in Sunderland, and we would hope that you, much like our customers, would agree.</p>
