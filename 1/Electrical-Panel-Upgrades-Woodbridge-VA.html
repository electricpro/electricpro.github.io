Existing buildings will always need upgrades, repairs and maintenance to electrical systems, while new residences need qualified electricians to install wiring and lighting. The meter and electrical surge suppressors protect from outside electrical interference. Lightning isn't the only thing that can damage your expensive electrical equipment.</p>
<p>Turn the breaker on to test the outlet and, if it works, turn the breaker off and secure the outlet back into the wall. No, not having a ground on the switch won't make the outlet fail to work.
