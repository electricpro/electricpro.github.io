Light switches tend to have a long lifespan, but you should be aware of the warning signs that your switches should be replaced. Inspect tools, power cords, and electrical fittings for damage or wear before to each use.</p>
<p>And if you're worried about lights drawing insects to the garden, Moyer suggests placing a bluer light far away from where you relax outdoors.
