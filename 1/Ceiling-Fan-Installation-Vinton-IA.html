The gasoline generator is also less fuel efficient compared to diesel generators. Buying a larger generator will consume more fuel to power the same appliances that a smaller generator could. However, since I expect the generators to run flawlessly (when everything else does not) and do not want to rely on external companies to help with servicing and maintenance - these kinds of issues decrease its value in my eyes.</p>
<p>If it immediately trips, the problem is probably in the circuit's wiring; you'll need an electrician. That's why our team of highly-trained electricians are standing by to help.

If the outlet you're replacing is at the end of the circuit, it wouldn't have the extra pair of black and white wires, since it doesn't need to continue the circuit, so you'll only have one black wire, one white wire, and one ground wire in that case.</p>
<p>Standby generators are much more complicated than portable ones and require professional installation as they tie into gas and other utility lines and usually require special permits. The first things you need to know about your house electrical wire are the basics. Whole home generators range anywhere from $3,000 to up to $15,000 depending on the specific unit and fuel source.
