<p>Generators are sized according to wattage produced: The more watts, the bigger the unit - and the higher the price tag. Do not use extension cords or multi-outlet converters for appliances. And portable power stations are large batteries that store electricity for when you need it, the only option for someone who lives in an apartment, say, and has no way to safely run a generator outdoors. However, by installing surge protectors where needed, you can protect the multiple pieces of equipment that share a common electric outlet.</p>
<p>If you have a serious electrical short circuit in the middle of the night or you lose power at a moment when you need it, you can count on the emergency electricians at Linc Electric to be there when you need us.

If your current line can hold 150-amps, you might want to consider that if your budget cannot handle nearly $5,000 for the upgrade to 200-amp service. The licensed electricians of MB Heating & Cooling help you determine the right size generator that is capable of powering you through a utility outage.</p>
