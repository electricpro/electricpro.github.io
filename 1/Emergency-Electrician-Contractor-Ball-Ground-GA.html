<p>SCIENTIFIC & ELECTRICAL CO. is listed in Trade India's list of verified sellers offering supreme quality of etc. It's okay if you aren't 100% sure what constitutes an electrical emergency. A: Anyone who will perform nonexempt electrical work without supervision by a licensed electrician or master electrician DOES require a license.

Older homes with ungrounded outlets or homes with improper wiring and grounding will not be helped by a surge protector without the necessary upgrades.

Lawnmowers and hedge cutters can cut through their own electrical cables, causing a risk of electric shock, so be vigilant when you're gardening, and never use appliances in the rain or on wet grass. Outdoor lighting maintenance is one more critical service Lighthouse Outdoor LivingÂ® provides its customers.</p>
