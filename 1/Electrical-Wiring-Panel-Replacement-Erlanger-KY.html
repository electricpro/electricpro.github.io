<p>Safeguard your electronics and appliances with SurgeGuard® — the most powerful surge protection available. The dimensions, mechanical designs, and even the general appearance of light switches have changed slowly over time. When we offer our installation services, we generally provide you with multiple options, ensuring you get a system that works for your budget. We also offer maintenance plans for maintaining your generator, so it's in great working order whenever you need to use it. Once your generator has been installed, our tech will talk to you about which affordable maintenance plan is the right choice for you and your budget.</p>
<p>GFCIs prevent electrical accidents by shutting the power off when an electric current is detected to be flowing through the water.
