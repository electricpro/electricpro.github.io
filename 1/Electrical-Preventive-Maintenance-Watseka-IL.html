Most homeowners call electricians in an emergency or if they're building or remodeling. Portable backup generators range in price from $500 for a 3,250-watt unit to $1,500 for a 10,000-watt unit.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the cable referred to in this document is two-pronged; i.e., there are two independent wires inside. At All Seasons Air Conditioning & Heating, we offer comprehensive electrical services you can count on to keep your home running at peak efficiency.

Landscape lighting is specifically referred to in 406.8(B)(2)(a) for all receptacles located in a wet location.</p>

If your current line can hold 150-amps, you might want to consider that if your budget cannot handle nearly $5,000 for the upgrade to 200-amp service. The licensed electricians of MB Heating & Cooling help you determine the right size generator that is capable of powering you through a utility outage.</p>
