<p>When it comes to your Birmingham home's electrical system, there are a number of different components that all work together in order to supply your home with the steady stream of power you have come to expect, and your electrical wiring is a major component within that system. A whole-house surge protector is a device installed to protect all the appliances in your home from any electrical spikes by limiting excess electrical current through blocking its flow or shorting it to the ground.</p>
<p>At Hoffman Electrical, we provide commercial standby generator installation and repair, so your Clearwater business can stay open when your competitors can't. In addition, you can get surge protectors specifically designed for phone and cable lines.
