<p>We pride ourselves on being ready to respond to any emergency electrical situation that may arise. Short circuits are dangerous with high voltage power sources because the high currents encountered can cause large amounts of heat energy to be released. The first step is to screw a wire nut onto each wire (except for the ground wire, as it doesn't need one) and spread out the wires as far apart as possible. Setting up landscape lighting is a good idea when establishing the boundaries of an outdoor path.</p>

The white (neutral) wire connects to the silver screw, or you place it in the back wire hole on the same side of the device as the silver screw. The white wire is the "neutral" wire, which takes any unused electricity and current and sends them back to the breaker panel.</p>
