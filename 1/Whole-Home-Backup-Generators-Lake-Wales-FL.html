<p>Rather than sticking up from the ground, these lights are designed to lay almost flush with the ground. Suspecting a short, I disconnected the white from the "jumper" splice and the switch and ran a separate wire directly from the switch to the jumper splice in its place. Electricians specializing in construction primarily install wiring systems into factories, businesses, and new homes. Landscape lighting is specifically referred to in 406.8(B)(2)(a) for all receptacles located in a wet location.</p>
<p>All electronics have a power supply that takes the incoming wall current (120v in the US), filters it for noise, and converts it into whatever the device needs. Know the location of your home's electrical panel. However, I have lost the "switched" function for the other outlets in the room. You can use a tiny screwdriver or a paper clip to remove the pushed in wires. Most of the time, however, even common electrical issues can be easy to overlook such as dimming lights, faulty light switches and not having enough power outlets because they seem harmless.</p>
