<h2>Home Electrical Safety And Security in High Point North Carolina</h2>
<p>This 12 kW home standby generator can power a home up to 5,500 sq. ft. with a 4-ton air conditioner or other large or small appliances plugged on. It has a compact size, that makes it 50% smaller and 60% more quieter than previous 12 kW generators. In order for this to happen, there may need to be an energy management system installed that controls what is powered on and at what time. You can DIY a light switch with a little electrical know-how.

<h3>Lighting Fixture Installation & Repair High Point NC 27265</h3>
<p>Permanent home standby generators - depending on the configuration and model - are mostly built to have an auto-transfer switch that recognizes interruption in the power supply and provides power to home appliances, including air-conditioning systems. Your generator's fuel consumption may increase over time, which is an indicator of broken parks or the system wearing out as a whole. We only sell and work on whole-house automatic standby generators, not portables.</p>
