<h2>Home Electrical Safety And Security in High Point North Carolina</h2>
<p>This 12 kW home standby generator can power a home up to 5,500 sq. ft. with a 4-ton air conditioner or other large or small appliances plugged on. It has a compact size, that makes it 50% smaller and 60% more quieter than previous 12 kW generators.

<h3>Lighting Fixture Installation & Repair High Point NC 27265</h3>
<p>Permanent home standby generators - depending on the configuration and model - are mostly built to have an auto-transfer switch that recognizes interruption in the power supply and provides power to home appliances, including air-conditioning systems. Your generator's fuel consumption may increase over time, which is an indicator of broken parks or the system wearing out as a whole. We only sell and work on whole-house automatic standby generators, not portables.</p>
