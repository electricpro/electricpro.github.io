<p>It is a good idea to speak to your electrical professional about layering the whole-house surge protection, especially if there's an elaborate home entertainment system or other expensive electronic set-up. Just happened to come across this article while looking for some other information of landscape lighting and was drawn in by the clever website name (always good to be handy!) but wanted to point out a couple of small changes that can make a HUGE difference in how long your install will continue to work perfectly, or work at all.</p>
<p>Today, most homes have what is officially called the electrical service panel, or simply, the service panel. Check for a second hot wire also present in the same box. Unlike standard lightbulbs, recessed lighting bulbs are concealed within the wall or ceiling, creating a pleasant lighting effect without being noticeable. LED lights are also flexible. Finally, some households overuse power cords. Installing a low-voltage lighting system is both safe and inexpensive.</p>
