Or you could remove the wires from the switch and tie those two together, bypassing the switch. Refueling-If your generator runs on gas, this step won't apply to you because the gas is sourced from an outside pipe.</p>

There are many projects you can take on at home without any professional assistance, but electrical wiring is not recommended for those who've never done it before.</p>
