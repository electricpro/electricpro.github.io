<h3>Electrical Problem in Jacksonville NC: How Do I Choose A Load Center?</h3>
<p>If the same thing occurred with a three-pronged outlet and you plugged something (with three prongs) into the outlet, the ground wire would absorb the shock and take the current into the ground where it can be safely neutralized. You have now installed a new electrical outlet and can take advantage of the safety and convenience of relocating your power needs. Circuit breakers keep tripping: This is an indication your electrical panel may be wearing down and should be replaced.</p>
<p>If you have a serious electrical short circuit in the middle of the night or you lose power at a moment when you need it, you can count on the emergency electricians at Linc Electric to be there when you need us.
