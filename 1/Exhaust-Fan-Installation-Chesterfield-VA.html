<p>About the only electrical code restriction for a low voltage system is that the transformer be connected to a GFCI protected receptacle or circuit, when installed in locations that require GFCI protection (see Common GFCI Location Requirements ). When it comes to household electricity, there's a lot more to consider than simply turning a switch On and Off. This applies especially to landlords, who would breach the law if the tenants' health is jeopardised by unlicensed electrical repairs.</p>

With no wiring, installation is much cheaper than traditional lighting as no concrete or landscaping needs to be torn up and reset and there is no waiting for the utility company to connect the lights.</p>
