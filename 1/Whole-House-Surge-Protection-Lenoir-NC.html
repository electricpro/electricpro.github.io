You may have difficulty selling your home if you do not have the right electrical safety certificates. However, there is a general understanding within the electrical trade of the standard duties and skills associated with residential electrical installation, upgrades and repair.

Since a watt (wattage) has been mentioned, this is also important to consider when buying inexpensive home standby generators.

Thankfully, it wasn't anything more serious, but it woke you up about electrical safety.</p>
<p>In order to know the gauge of the wire and the circuit information, you'll have to check the cable-sheath labeling. Watch out: if the "hot" wire in your light switch is on a 3-way circuit you may not always have power at your add-on receptacle.
