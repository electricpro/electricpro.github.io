<h3>Surge Protection For Your Home Mars Hill NC 28754</h3>
<p>Landscape lighting typically relies on stepped-down power from your house. Wiring diagram shows how the electrical power enters the ceiling light electrical box and then a two conductor cable is installed to the switch without a neutral conductor. You can install your landscape light fixtures and wires before you turn on the transformer. Not only can having older electrical service ruin your current appliances and devices, but it could be a safety hazard as well.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, you'll want to have wiring that is long enough to extend 3 inches outside of the electrical box. For example, for an installation where you would want to hide wires behind a wall, the wires could be surrounded by insulation, creating a warmer environment. Circuit breakers provide the same type of time-delay features that equal-size time-delay fuses provide. Because a light switch is indeed switching a hot wire to the light, you've got power at the switch location.</p>
