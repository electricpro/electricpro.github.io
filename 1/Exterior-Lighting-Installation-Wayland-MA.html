It is designed for closer placement near the house as you can have it as close as 18 inches from your house which can cut down on the installation cost. Usually the products having a higher number of joules also have an increased clamping voltage, yielding a larger "let-through" voltage for the appliances or electronics that need protecting.</p>
<p>Non-fusable safety switch required on outdoor installations, and high-voltage indoor applications such as 90 amp tankless electric water heater where breaker box not in plain sight of equipment.
