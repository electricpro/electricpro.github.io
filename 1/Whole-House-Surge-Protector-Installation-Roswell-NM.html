The boxes have labels to tell you what color wires go into each hole. Either unplug some items or call an electrician to discuss your increased electrical needs. Safety: A neutral can be just as dangerous as a hot wire, with the potential to electrocute you or to "ground out" and electrify any metal it comes in contact with.</p>

This isn't too surprising, as being an electrician often means crouching, kneeling and bending to reach the electrical installations you're supposed to be working on. With that in mind, it is advised that you take the proper precautions to ensure that your body remains healthy: electricians should stretch often and consider investing in knee pads to wear while working.</p>
