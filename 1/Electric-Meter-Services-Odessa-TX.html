Electronics must be protected from inside the home and because each member's needs will be a little different, it is the member's responsibility to purchase point of use” devices. Older controllers use two overloads, while newer units are required to have three overloads in accordance with changes in the National Electrical Code®.</p>
<p>Remove the wall plate covering the existing switch by unscrewing the two screws. Electric current travels from point to point because there is a greater electric potential energy on one end of the wire than there is on the opposite end.
