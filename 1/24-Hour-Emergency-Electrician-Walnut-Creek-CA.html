<p>Landscape lighting typically relies on stepped-down power from your house. Wiring diagram shows how the electrical power enters the ceiling light electrical box and then a two conductor cable is installed to the switch without a neutral conductor. You can install your landscape light fixtures and wires before you turn on the transformer.
