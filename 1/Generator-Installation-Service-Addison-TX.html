<p>Detroit and Grand Rapids issue electrical licenses locally and have their own application forms. A 100-amp breaker box may be sufficient for households with minimal use of electricity, but most modern homes require 200 amps. Note: Cast brass AMP® ONE fixtures feature a lifetime warranty.

<p>Report any broken poles or trees on the power line or any downed electric lines to NOVEC or the police immediately.
