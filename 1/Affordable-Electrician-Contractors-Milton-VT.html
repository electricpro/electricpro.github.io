<p>However, you are approaching the age threshold and we would recommend having an annual electrical inspection performed by either a certified home inspector or a licensed electrician. While LEDs are becoming a more popular choice for this kind of project, if you decide to go with traditional halogen lighting then you will to need buy a transformer with a maximum wattage of 20% more than your total wattage. During a power outage you would plugin your portable generator, start it up, and turn the transfer switch to "generator mode." We can install transfer switches that manage your entire home or just your most important circuits.</p>
<p>Bruss Landscaping specializes in carefully designing and installing exclusively LED low voltage outdoor lighting systems to enhance the landscapes we design. During an apprenticeship, trainee electricians must complete 144 hours per year of technical training, where they learn about blueprints, safety and first aid practices, electrical code requirements, mathematics, and electrical theory. In other states, electricians are licensed at the local (city, county) level.</p>

Most homes will have a few outdoor electrical sockets, but if you have one that is too far away from your light fixtures, you may need to call in a professional electrician to wire one closer for you. When installing wiring, electricians use handtools such as conduit benders, screwdrivers, pliers, knives, hacksaws, and wire strippers, as well as power tools such as drills and saws.</p>
