<p>The standby generator and the transfer switch are installed by a professional to the home's existing electrical wiring. When you call our 24-hour emergency electrical service, you will talk to a licensed electrician who will ask you a few questions about your residential problem and dispatch an emergency electrician as soon as possible. Just answering the question as to whether you need the system to power the entire house or just emergency loads will help you determine the transfer switch size.</p>
<p>And other light fixtures are completely weatherproof. Our NATE-certified technicians are trained to install portable and whole-home generators for any home in the area. Electrical Contractor License: According to the Board, municipalities can accept contracting business owners, their partners, chairman of the board or CEO that present the contracting business.

<p>Pendant lights are a great option if you are looking to install task lighting. Electrical cords and extension cords should never be run across a doorway or underneath a rug or carpet.

These devices often have photo cells or timers that control when the lights turn on, so you don't have to flip a switch every night.</p>
