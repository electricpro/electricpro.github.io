Although a lot of manufactures supply their fixtures with plastic quick connectors”, we recommend that you throw those away, and use silicon filled wire connectors.

Consumers can use ESFI's In Home Electrical Safety Check and Out-door Electrical Safety Check booklets to conduct an electrical safety audit of their homes.</p>
