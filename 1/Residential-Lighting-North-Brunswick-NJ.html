<p>As we mentioned earlier, all low-voltage lighting fixtures must be certified by an NRTL to pass inspection. This guarantees that the transition from regular electrical power to a standby generator system will be almost instantaneous. Here are signs you need an electrical panel upgrade. Make sure the cord can handle the electric demands of your equipment. Unplug any cords or extension cords from these outlets and do not use until a qualified electrician has checked the wiring.</p>
<p>If your transformer low voltage side feeds ( hooks up to ) a relay, then you'd take the farthest lights away from that relay and hook them up BACK to that same relay where the circuit takes off to feed the first lights. But none of these lights can compare to the LED light bulb. Check electrical cords to make sure they are not running across doorways or under carpets where they are can get damaged.
