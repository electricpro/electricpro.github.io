If the total amount of amps used in that room surpasses 15 amps, the fuse will shut off to keep the outlets and wiring from overheating. Extension cords: There are types of these specifically made for inside or outside. If you're interested in owning the most reliable generator on the block, be sure to contact Guin Service and let us know you're interested in our generator maintenance services.</p>
