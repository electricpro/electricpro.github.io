<h3>Industrial Electrical Services in Old Lyme CT</h3>
<p>With a properly planned electrical maintenance schedule and a reliable contractor, you should never have the need to attempt to replace your old wiring or something like that, because that would be a dangerous thing to attempt a DIY on. If you know you've had a serious electrical event (like lighting blew out a transformer down the street), it's probably worth replacing your surge protector just in case. Loose or broken wires that are still slightly touching will allow the light switch to function.</p>

<p>The problem is that a GFCI monitors the current on the neutral and hot wires; when they are unbalanced it will trip. In new construction, GFCI receptacles are required by code where electricity and water are in close proximity, as in the bathroom, kitchen, garage, swimming pool area, crawl-space, unfinished basement, or on exterior outlets. All Coastal Source fixtures are designed to be forever serviceable. This is defined as a business, person or company employing electricians to carry out electrical installation work for profit.</p>
