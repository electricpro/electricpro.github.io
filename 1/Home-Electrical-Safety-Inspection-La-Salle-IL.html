<p>Journey Worker Electrician - You must show proof of five years and more than 10,000 hours of experience in residential or commercial wiring. After the first hour, you'll be charged for the actual time it takes the electrician to do the job. This is a sign that the old electrical wiring in your home isn't able to run enough electricity to appliances. Or, proof of 8,000 hours experience as a journeyman with 20 to 50% of the experience being completed in residential work.</p>

Light switches and outlets in your home may not seem like a big to-do at first, but when it comes to your home's electrical system, their the point of entry for every single thing you need to do. Replacing these in older homes can be a hassle - but necessary - and keeping updated on your maintenance is vital for sustained ease of use and longevity.</p>
