<p>Make the space in the new panel for the breakers. Backup home generators can keep your most important appliances up and running from computers, fridges, and necessary medical devices. Similarly, inside box 2, attach the black wire from the three-wire bundle (black, white, copper) to the black terminal on the new switch. Unlike other maintenance and repair tasks that can be quickly fixed, when dealing with electricity it is always best to call a professional. Unfortunately, many Bergen and Hudson County homes still have outdated electrical panels or are in need of replacement for their circuit breakers and electric meters.</p>
<p>Then reconnect the motor starter coil, overload circuit and field wiring, restore incoming power and start the motor. Some of the switches are doubled or tripled together because they power appliances that require large electricity loads, such as air conditioners and electric dryers. When you turn the switch off, it interrupts the electricity that flows through the black wire from the power source to the fixture. There are many different light installations that can help enhance the visibility and aesthetics of any room in your house.</p>
