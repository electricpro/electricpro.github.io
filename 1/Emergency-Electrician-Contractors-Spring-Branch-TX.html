I have another neighbor who leaves several safety lights on all night long. These tasks, though important, are only one of the many electricians might tackle.

<p>The earliest standardized method of wiring in buildings, in common use in North America from about 1880 to the 1930s, was knob and tube (K&T) wiring: single conductors were run through cavities between the structural members in walls and ceilings, with ceramic tubes forming protective channels through joists and ceramic knobs attached to the structural members to provide air between the wire and the lumber and to support the wires. Our Linwood, Northfield, and Egg Harbor Township NJ area team has years of experience installing all different kinds of lighting.</p>
