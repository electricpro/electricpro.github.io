There may be no tell-tale signs of bad wiring, overloads, or surge damage, making professional electrical inspections so important. These wires are more effective in reducing electrical interference, which makes them efficient for telephone cabling.</p>
<p>Specifically these are hard wired lights, not merely lamps plugged into outlets. Even if you take all the above electrical safety precautions, it's still a good idea to have the right protection in the case of a fire. Here's what to look for when shopping for a surge protector, and how to use it safely once you bring it home.
