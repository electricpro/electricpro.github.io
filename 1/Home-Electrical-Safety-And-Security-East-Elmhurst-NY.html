A commercial electrician installs complex security, power, and fire protection systems in commercial buildings such as offices or stores. Electrical panels can be very dangerous in inexperienced hands.

The best answer to 'œhow to become a journeyman electrician' is to work under the watchful eye of a licensed electrician, licensed electrical contractor, or registered master electrician as part of an electrician apprenticeship program.
