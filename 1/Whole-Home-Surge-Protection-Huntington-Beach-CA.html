<p>And now new vibration testing tools provide the maintenance professional with a valuable new way not just to listen, but to find mechanical problems and fixes: these new troubleshooting tools are engineered to detect and evaluate machine vibration immediately and recommend any needed repairs. Likewise, the new ground wire is spliced into the circuit at the receptacle. This will ensure that all of the fixtures in your lighting design are receiving adequate energy to function at their full desired brightness.</p>
