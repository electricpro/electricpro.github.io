These lights are really easy to install, just use the stake and push them into the ground along a garden path, throughout a flower bed, or around the pool.</p>
<p>Like everything in life, it pays to be prepared in the event of an electrical emergency.

Outdated and inefficient, they lack the proper grounding plug newer outlets have, which means they're more likely to cause an electrical fire in your home. Excellent services, details of job explained clearly up front. The best way for me to install these is to have a 12V power supply in the basement (probably just a computer power supply) and pull 2-conductor cables up from there.</p>
