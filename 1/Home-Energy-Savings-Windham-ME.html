The joule rating tells you how much energy the surge protector can absorb before it fails. Most common form of indoor residential electrical wiring.</p>
<p>So, the first rule here is not to use electrical appliances when the ground is wet.

In other words, if you find yourself constantly tripping your circuit breakers when one appliance is plugged in or turned on, chances are you need to upgrade the circuitry. LED lighting is also a great choice because it is much less expensive than traditional incandescent lighting (saves as much as 50% on power usage) and can last much longer as well.</p>
