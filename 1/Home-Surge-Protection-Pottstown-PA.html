A new circuit breaker or service panel will give you upgraded electrical capacity throughout your home. Limit your choices to those devices that are truly essential during a power outage and you'll keep your total costs down.</p>

By simply installing a surge protector in order to prevent those types of things from happening can save your home, save you money, at the same time as saving lives.
