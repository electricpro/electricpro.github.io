If you find yourself using power strips or extension cords in your home, then it's a strong sign that you are using more electricity than your home was designed for. Each lighting fixture is hardwired, with special attention paid to the concealment of unsightly wires, which are usually buried underground whenever possible.

<p>If the power is in the receptacle box, use a 3 wire cable between receptacle box and switch box. The best answer to 'œhow to become a journeyman electrician' is to work under the watchful eye of a licensed electrician, licensed electrical contractor, or registered master electrician as part of an electrician apprenticeship program.
