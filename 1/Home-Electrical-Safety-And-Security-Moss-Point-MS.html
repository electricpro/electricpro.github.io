<p>Children must learn that appliances such as hair dryers and electric shavers are not toys and must never be played with in the bathroom.

Next, unroll the spool of low-voltage electrical cable and lay the cable beside the fixtures. With preventive maintenance, you'll not only save money on future repairs but also protect your family from the dangers of an electrical issue.</p>
<p>Because there's little risk of electric shock, Hart says he likes to turn the lights on while installing low-voltage systems. To keep appliances safe, research the wattage requirements and electrical loads before powering them up through a generator. To do this, you will need to briefly touch together specific pairs of the wires: touch the common wire (typically white or yellow) to the ON wire (typically red) to turn the light ON. Next touch the common wire to the OFF wire (typically black) to turn the light OFF.</p>
<p>Some older equipment and wiring appeared well-maintained, performing effectively and safely. There are some simple steps homeowners can take to protect their families and homes from electrical hazards.

You can avoid overloading your generator with surges by turning on connected appliances one at a time.</p>
