ElectricMasters installs copper component load centers (i.e. breaker boxes) that come with a six-year parts and labor warranty and a lifetime manufacturer's warranty on the load center and breakers.</p>
<p>Although it is permitted to wire lights and receptacles on the same circuit I usually avoid doing that for the sake of the people living in the home. You're in your business, and you're darn good at it. Unfortunately, that means that many (or most) electrical contractors all look the same.

Our approach to the commercial lighting installation, commercial lighting repairs and commercial lighting replacement is different and wholesome. As part of an upgrade to wiring new properties new fuseboards are often offered to enhance the safety of your property.</p>
<p>Like a car, an emergency standby generator is powered by internal combustion engine that can run nonstop for days at a time, so they require a considerable amount of maintenance. Electrical panels are one of those things that just work until they don't. When it detects an interruption in your main utility service, it safely switches you from that power source to the standby generator's power. Industrial projects require highly skilled personnel with Safety training and equipment.</p>
<p>And, no one knows generators better than Diamond Electric. Your regular surge protectors are useless in this case and if you have any electrical devices plugged in, they're going to be toast in a split second. Especially if the new electric panel is physically larger than the one being replaced, the original wires may not reach the circuit breakers in the new panel. Electrical service panels have components inside them that are designed to fail: fuses or circuit breakers.</p>
<p>We will help you to decide on whether you should have your outdated fuse panel replaced with a modern Circuit Breaker panel. While they are very different to the typical home consumer, a fuse box serves the same role of a circuit breaker in a building: to prevent the overloading of circuits by cutting off the flow of power and reducing risk of fire.
