In Kansas, for instance, it allows the electrician to work without supervision, act as an administrator to electrical contractors and supervise junior electricians. In order to make a stronger connection you can also bypass this connection altogether, splitting the cable and wiring it with wire nuts as you would a traditional light fixture.</p>

Knowing whether your home's electrical system has been updated to safely handle all the electrical current your family uses is imperative.
