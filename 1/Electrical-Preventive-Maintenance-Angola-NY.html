<h3>When Should You Call a Professional Electrician in Angola NY?</h3>
<p>Now, I'd guess this is how things are connected in the light switch box: neutral from outlet box to lights via wire nut, hot from outlet box to switch, and hot from switch to lights via wire nut. Your transformer needs to be the right wattage to accommodate the lighting you plan to install. If none of that is helpful about all that is left is to run a new wire from the switch to an outlet for the disposal. Turn the power back on and wearing electrically insulated gloves with glove protectors, and a face shield CAREFULLY (You can get shocked or electrocuted) check with a volt meter or pigtail light bulb to see which wire is the LINE.</p>
