Also, within the broad CII category, commercial construction is the top money maker at 26.7 percent of revenue, versus 13.6 percent for industrial projects and 8.6 percent for institutional work. In many older homes, the circuitry is hooked into a fuse box as its primary control panel.</p>

These devices often have photo cells or timers that control when the lights turn on, so you don't have to flip a switch every night.</p>
