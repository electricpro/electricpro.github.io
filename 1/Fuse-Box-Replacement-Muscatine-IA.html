<p>Electrical Contractor License: You need to pass and open book exam on the National Electric Code. Our home electrical safety checklist is meant to reduce these numbers and protect homeowners everywhere. We will evaluate your needs and provide you with a free estimate of the work needed to correct the issues observed. So, it is important for you to have a good understanding of how circuit breakers work and the types of maintenance procedures that are typically performed on them.</p>
<p>We pride ourselves on being ready to respond to any emergency electrical situation that may arise. Short circuits are dangerous with high voltage power sources because the high currents encountered can cause large amounts of heat energy to be released. The first step is to screw a wire nut onto each wire (except for the ground wire, as it doesn't need one) and spread out the wires as far apart as possible. Setting up landscape lighting is a good idea when establishing the boundaries of an outdoor path.</p>
