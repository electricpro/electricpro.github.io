<p>Spotlighting: We typically highlight one or two of your property's focal points using spotlighting. The president of the Electrical Safety Foundation International explains two campaigns created to save lives. A good flow of information between the customer and the electrical contractor is critical to keep a construction job on schedule and budget. If you experience blown fuses, flickering lights, or simply have an old breaker in need of service, it's time to let a professional take a look.</p>

It's easy to improve the energy efficiency of lighting systems by up to 90% when you use lower voltage lighting.</p>

<p>Stab-lock connections are the number one cause of electrical service repair calls. Georgia and a few other states waive licensing as long as the residential electrician works for a licensed contractor. You don't just want to go with the first cheap computer surge protector you can find. Low voltage lighting systems usually use LED bulbs because they are energy efficient and draw a small amount of current. However, propane gas or natural gas generators consume more fuel per kilowatt of power produced than diesel generators.</p>
<p>In case a situation arises, like a hurricane or other type of powerful storm, you'll be glad you had Guin Service install your generator because you know the job was done correctly the first time. Most homes will have a few outdoor electrical sockets, but if you have one that is too far away from your light fixtures, you may need to call in a professional electrician to wire one closer for you. When installing wiring, electricians use handtools such as conduit benders, screwdrivers, pliers, knives, hacksaws, and wire strippers, as well as power tools such as drills and saws.</p>

<p>For instance, pairing copper wire with aluminum wire can cause corrosion problems which cause the connection to become unstable. The simplest and most common light switch is actually referred to by hardware dealers and electricians as a single-pole light switch.‚Äù With a single-pole light switch, flipping the lever up completes the circuit, turning lights or appliances on, and flipping it down breaks the circuit, turning lights or receptacles off. If you're concerned about protecting equipment while you're away or after office hours, look for surge protectors that completely cut off the power supply after a huge spike.</p>
<p>A backup home generator takes mechanical energy and converts it into electrical energy. Most plastic boxes for two or more switches have built-in cable clamps.

<p>Outlet circuit AFCIs protect cords and equipment that are plugged into an outlet. Sometimes outlets have small holes on the back that you can stick the end of the wire into and tighten the screw down, but this isn't always the case. Our Virginia Beach electricians are prepared to walk you through and conduct every step of the selection and installation process if you are looking to purchase or replace a generator. Avoid overloading double adapters or power boards with too many appliances as this can cause fires.</p>
<p>Enhance the ambiance and visual appeal of your outdoor space with professional landscape lighting. New construction and home remodeling electrical work. If some of the lights are dim or are out completely, this will definitely hinder the beauty of the landscape lighting.

Next step is to disconnect the current from that circuit either by switching off and removing the fuse or by simply switching off the circuit breaker.</p>
<p>First, connecting the wires leading to downstream outlets with wire connectors creates a more secure connection. Hook the wires onto the new receptacle. We didn't buy a whole-house generator because I didn't want to run out of fuel with an extended power loss. Landscape lighting is also more affordable than ever coming in dozens of styles at a wide range of prices. Schedule with us to provide a safety inspection of your home and call us to perform a full electrical inspection on a home you may be looking to purchase.</p>
