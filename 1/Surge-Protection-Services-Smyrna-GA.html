Usually the products having a higher number of joules also have an increased clamping voltage, yielding a larger "let-through" voltage for the appliances or electronics that need protecting.</p>
<p>By purchasing the proper outlet surge protector you are taking a preventive measure that can save you thousands, not only in terms of equipment but in data as well. It's not a huge deal if you mix them up, as it will simply switch to the bottom receptacle being the switched one—you can always switch them back.
