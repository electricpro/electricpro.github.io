You can't just plug in the TV — there's the TV and the receiver and the Roku and whatever else.” The group resorted to plugging power strips and extension cords into virtually every outlet.

You must complete the exam application LIC41 , check the box that indicates you are an Master or Special Electrician candidate, and submit the application with the $525.00 fee to the Department (see contact information below).</p>
