<p>With a simple service call, we'll get your lighting system looking like new again whether we installed it originally or it was an existing system. After your service panel is upgraded, there's a step you can take to get even higher performance from your home electric system. Generally, yellow colored wirings are used as switch legs for controlling units such as fans, light and other outlets that require switches. If you aren't sure if your home has 220 volt service, call up your utility company, or have an electrician come take a look.</p>
<p>Outdoor lighting has the ability to transform even the most ordinary looking spaces into a dramatic area just by highlighting architectural features or landscape, while adding security and even value to your property. The 14-2 Romex®'s black wire is to be connected to a 15 amp breaker. Booking a professional to deal with your electrical wiring and lights means you're no longer limited by your own abilities. Electrical work is dangerous and always best left to a Licensed Electrical Contractor with the expertise, equipment and training to do the job safely.</p>
