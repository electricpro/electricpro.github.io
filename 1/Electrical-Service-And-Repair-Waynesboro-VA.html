Circuit breakers play a critical role in protecting the people and equipment in your data center, and are integral in limiting the damage should a fault occur.</p>

Surge protectors provide you with more electrical outlets as well as protect electrical appliances from surges.

Get the plates detached by a certified electrician in case tiling is being performed around the light fittings or switches.</p>
