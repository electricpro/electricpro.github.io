One circuit supplies the outlet that is controlled by a wall switch. Solar powered lighting has come a long way. BHEL is India's top power generation equipment manufacturer.</p>
<p>You can pull on the wires in the wire nut and if it doesn't come off, it is ready to go. Install that dimmer back into the box and put your cover plate back on and now you will have control over your for some reason you go down stairs, and you turn your circuit breaker back on and you come upstairs test the outlet you have just installed and it doesn't work, what you want to do is go back and double check your terminals and make sure the wires that you have installed are tight and in the proper location, and if there are any other wires or wire nuts in that box check them to make sure they are tight, once you have double checked all your connections, you can turn your circuit breaker back on and check you outlet, you should be fine.</p>
