<p>Electrical Contractor - You must have held a supervisory or managerial position in commercial, industrial or residential electrical work.

When outlets are installed upside down, the ground prong is facing up, meaning it's nearly impossible to cause a spark in the event the plug pulls away from the wall.</p>
<p>The inspection will help identify potential sources of electrical fires, ensuring you make the changes needed to keep your home safe. Outdated electrical systems in older homes can benefit from an upgrade of light fixtures. Safety could be an issue, but some engineers argue that glass fuses offer a reasonable amount of protection.
