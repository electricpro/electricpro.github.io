<p>Low voltage landscape lighting is safer for use outdoors because it reduces the risks of electrocution when installing a system or repairing one. We'll take care of all the details and provide complete lighting solutions that you can enjoy without any hassle. From path lights to step lights to led rope lights and recessed trim lighting, the variety is endless. The transformer can be installed on the side of the house, in a basement or garage or on a post outside.</p>
<p>For example, if you add up the wattages of all your fixtures for a total of 200 Watts then you at least need a transformer with a maximum output of 200 Watts. Whether or not a half-hot outlet is for lighting is debatable, but you must still have a neutral in the switch box. Color output from LED lighting is also variable. Light switches tend to have a long lifespan, but you should be aware of the warning signs that your switches should be replaced. Inspect tools, power cords, and electrical fittings for damage or wear before to each use.</p>
<p>Our outdoor lighting contractors place your lights against a surface with the beams pointed up. This creates a shadow that illuminates the wall's or stone work's texture. The bare copper wire that is nearly black was a clue in tracking down a neutral and ground wiring failure at this building. Our lighting contractors are licensed, bonded and extremely professional. Group and label the wires in the switch boxes so you'll know how to connect them after the drywall is complete.</p>
<p>This is the reason why most people suffer electrical shock because of the electrical wiring that are grounded. Licensed electrician requirements formally define the electrician profession, and set a universal standard of excellence. Maintaining correct electrical safety will not only keep you and your family safe, but it will also save you money by avoiding unnecessary repairs caused by to electrical fault damage.
