Older homes' electrical panels often top out at 60 or 100 amps, but most newer homes have 200-amp panels that meet your family's electricity needs now with plenty of room for future growth. The voltage drop in the main power wires from the generation source or the battery to the bus should not exceed 2 percent of the regulated voltage, when the generator is carrying rated current or the battery is being discharged at the 5-minute rate.</p>
<p>Track lighting is a great, space-saving, versatile, and artistic way to illuminate your home or business. Below are some of the jobs that electrical contractors can provide residential customers. Install a subtle, indirect lighting fixture in your outdoor rooms.

<p>Whether you need new lights for professional purposes or aesthetic reasons, your electrician will have the know-how to get it done. Although a lot of manufactures supply their fixtures with plastic quick connectors”, we recommend that you throw those away, and use silicon filled wire connectors.

Consumers can use ESFI's In Home Electrical Safety Check and Out-door Electrical Safety Check booklets to conduct an electrical safety audit of their homes.</p>
<p>The main types of circuit breakers are single pole, double pole, arc fault circuit interrupters (AFCO) and ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCI). Generally, the rule is that the generator should be located as close as possible to the fuel supply and transfer switch. In fact the only opportunity for danger when handling or installation is when making the connection to the standard voltage power source or when using a much too small wire size. Electricians passionate about their profession should find numerous opportunities throughout their careers.</p>
