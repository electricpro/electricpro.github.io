A whole-house surge protector is a device installed to protect all the appliances in your home from any electrical spikes by limiting excess electrical current through blocking its flow or shorting it to the ground.</p>
<p>Outdoor lighting has the ability to transform even the most ordinary looking spaces into a dramatic area just by highlighting architectural features or landscape, while adding security and even value to your property.
