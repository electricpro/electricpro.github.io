If only some of the lights at your home are out, you may not see the point of calling an electrical company. There is also a ton of information on residential LED lighting within the Rennselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) Program for the Evaluation and Analysis of Residential Lighting ( PEARL ). Especially useful is the Solid State Lighting division.</p>

Your specific needs will vary with your situation, but generally, all outdoor lighting systems are exposed to dirt, rainfall and irrigation, even snow and ice.
