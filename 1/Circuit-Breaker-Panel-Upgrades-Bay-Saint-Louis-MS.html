When the power supply from your utility company shuts down, your standby home generator kicks in within seconds to keep its assigned appliances operating normally.</p>
<p>Everything in your home that uses power is linked to your panel box. In the hub technique, a home run is brought from the transformer to a location within a cluster of fixtures. Or, you can ask the builder if you know who that is. If all else fails, a professional electrician can help you find the panel. A new circuit breaker or service panel will give you upgraded electrical capacity throughout your home. Limit your choices to those devices that are truly essential during a power outage and you'll keep your total costs down.</p>
