<p>Remove the top black wire and splice it to two 6" jumper wires. Upgrading an existing panel to 200 amps (which is currently a required minimum standard) costs between $850-1,150. A switch doesn't actually use a neutral wire; it simply takes hot” current from one location and either opens or closes the loop back to the device. Each generator must also be matched to an automatic transfer switch (ATS), which serves as the brains of the standby-power system and tells the generator when to kick on and turn off.</p>
<p>Once the voltage from an outlet surges, the surge protectors divert extra electricity into the grounding wire of an outlet. If you are interested in an electrical service panel upgrade, Dolce Electric Co schedules an in-office electrician Mesa AZ homeowners can consult with free of charge.
