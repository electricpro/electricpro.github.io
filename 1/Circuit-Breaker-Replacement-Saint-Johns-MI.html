Sometimes the wiring at a light box is passing the circuit through to various outlets in the area, so that care must be taken to connect everything back as it was. In this manner, the power must go from the receptacle box to the switch, through the switch and return to the receptacle box and GFI. Lighting repairs are an important because lighting is a part of the look and feel of a New Castle County home.</p>
<p>Usually, a circuit breaker sub panel will service one separate area that has a discrete function, such as a kitchen, shop, office, or addition.

Part of the current from the black wire will return through the white wire on the red wire GFCI, causing an imbalance in both GFCI's. This connects to the generator so you can plug in appliances without running (potentially risky) extension cords outdoors. The panel was never designed for this and and for that and several other reasons the local utility usually will not allow it. If they did, then you could add up 200 amps of solar since you would be coming in ahead of the main breaker.</p>
