<p>Improper Installation - If your home's breaker panel wasn't installed correctly the first time around, you may be experiencing frequent issues with it. Some surge protectors allow you time enough to shut down your computer without losing data or causing damage. Flickering lights, odd sounds from a fuse box, tripping breakers, and even smoke coming from outlets or outlets with burning smells are all warning signs of an outdated panel. TIP: If the wires to the power source are "plugged" into the back, then you can gently rock the power source back-and-fourth until they come free.</p>
<p>There are three protective devices that are designed to detect faults and quickly break the connection, helping to protect both your home from electrical fire, and your family from shock and electrocution. Maccarone Plumbing installs plumbing and HVAC systems, as well as offers options for repair and routine maintenance.
