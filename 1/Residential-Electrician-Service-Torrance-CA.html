When installing dimmers or smart dimmers, avoid CFL bulbs as they are not compatible with a lot of dimmers even though the bulbs say "dimmable." Smart light switches fall in the middle of the cost range, being less expensive than a fleet of individual bulbs and a bit pricier than smart plugs. 120 volt systems must maintain absolute moisture free which is difficult with the wires running underground.</p>

Or you can buy big 5-kw banks that cost $5,000 and will keep a few critical circuits in the house going for several hours or days (if used sparingly).

Many switches, dimmers and outlets fit decora rocker switch plates which come in a huge variety of finishes. Worst of all, they install different voltages than intended for the system or for the individual wire runs or circuits.
