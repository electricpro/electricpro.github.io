To offer renewable solar energy systems that replace conventional power generation solutions.

<p>A bird remains safe because it is sitting on a single wire and is at one point of contact—and consequently one electrical potential. If your business's backup generator is leaking fuel, not turning on, or isn't functioning as it should, contact Jaffe Electric online or call (301) 253-3778 for commercial generator repair in Maryland and throughout the DC and Northern Virginia area. Portable generators require the use of heavy-duty extension cords. Generators are sold by power output, as measured in watts.</p>
<p>If your home has an electric panel that is more than a generation old, it could be time for an upgrade. The position of the contacts can be verified by visual inspection or by removing power from the system, ('''CAUTION''': Circuit must be locked, tagged, and tried) lifting the leads to the temperature contacts, and using an ohmmeter to verify that the contacts are closed. You can avoid overloading your generator with surges by turning on connected appliances one at a time.</p>
