Next touch the common wire to the OFF wire (typically black) to turn the light OFF.</p>
<p>Whether you need new lights for professional purposes or aesthetic reasons, your electrician will have the know-how to get it done. Although a lot of manufactures supply their fixtures with plastic quick connectorsâ, we recommend that you throw those away, and use silicon filled wire connectors.
