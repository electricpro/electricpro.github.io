The bare ground wire—if there is one— is connected to the green grounding screw on the switch. Use a noncontact voltage tester like this to double-check that all wires in a box are dead” after turning off the circuit breaker.

<p>Install the landscape lights in beds, and use in-ground well lights for the yard. Place all the lights in their correct places then begin installing them. Water and electricity can be lethal so it is more important to maintain electrical safety in the kitchen and bathroom. If you must be close to power lines, you must first call your electrical utility company and they will assist you. If you see someone enter an electrical substation that should not be there, call the authorities and Vera Water and Power.</p>

With regular service, your landscape lighting system will perform as designed, and enhance your property for beauty and elegance season after season.
