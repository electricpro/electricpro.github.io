<p>If you need to buy or replace your point-of-use surge protectors, look for the UL label , or similar independent testing laboratory seal. It is designed for closer placement near the house as you can have it as close as 18 inches from your house which can cut down on the installation cost.

<p>Like a car, an emergency standby generator is powered by internal combustion engine that can run nonstop for days at a time, so they require a considerable amount of maintenance. Electrical panels are one of those things that just work until they don't.

Industrial projects require highly skilled personnel with Safety training and equipment.</p>
