<p>It is best, then, to have a professional install these low voltage landscape lights to minimize the risk of physical equipment damage. When installing dimmers or smart dimmers, avoid CFL bulbs as they are not compatible with a lot of dimmers even though the bulbs say "dimmable." Smart light switches fall in the middle of the cost range, being less expensive than a fleet of individual bulbs and a bit pricier than smart plugs. 120 volt systems must maintain absolute moisture free which is difficult with the wires running underground.</p>
<p>A common problem is a switch that does nothing or an electrical outlet that is not functional. Experience: Typically, a residential electrician uses single phase power supplies - 120 or 240 volts. Lay the wires alongside the lights - but do not attach yet. The BLS reports that jobs for electrical contractors are expected to increase 23 percent between 2010 and 2020. Although circuit breakers and electrical panels are safer and more reliable than fuse boxes, they are still prone to problems now and again.</p>

Electrical service upgrades (a larger size panel) can be considered when a new electric panel installation is the only option. Unlike portable generators, there are no smelly by-products of kerosene or gasoline.</p>

Layout the fixtures on the ground first so you get the layout you want.
