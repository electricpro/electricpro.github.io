<p>The application of LED's as landscape lighting fixtures was realized in the later half of the 20th century as more and more people focused in furthering lawn improvements and finding new ways to enhancing landscape designs with lights that would not pose much risk and at the same time would cut the operational cost over time. Except for farm wiring in some locations, a person or company acting as an electrical contractor in Michigan must be licensed by the State or in some cases the governmental jurisdiction in which the business is located or the person resides.</p>

Natural gas-powered generators run like gasoline-powered ones. Instead of the outlet being wired as always hot, it is connected to the switched hot.</p>
<p>Bi-fuel generators burn both natural gas and diesel at the same time in one engine. And for those of you who are still utilizing those old fashioned hanging dining fixtures that dangle with the intent of being centered over your kitchen or dining room table, it is time for those to hit the trash.

Our surge protection can help preserve life-saving medical equipment, important data, invaluable electrical systems, and more.</p>
