To make your backyard or garden pop this spring and summer, install some low-voltage lighting to illuminate fences, flower beds, and other features. Step 7: Remove the wire nut connecting the two neutral wires in the back of the box and add a third white wire to the mix. Protect your business, home, or family with an affordable power solution from Innovet Electrical & Heating and Cooling.</p>
<p>When designing or wiring landscape lights, it is extremely important not to go over the wattage capability of the transformer, plus by having the extra wattage available, will allow you to add more lighting to your system in the future if you desire. MVP Electric, Heating & Cooling provides professional electrical services in Kansas City, MO and the surrounding areas. Stephen: I can't imagine why a white wire is spliced to two blacks and folded into the box except to provide power to the switch, but also can't see that it would do any harm to add a pigtail to the blacks and terminate it on the unused brass screw now that you have broken the tab off.</p>
<p>Never plug one surge protector into another surge protector or power strip. The lights have clamps with metal teeth that pierce the cable insulation and tap directly into the power line. If at the switch, you have power between black and ground but none between black and neutral the most probable answer is a disconnected white neutral somewhere. You will need to find an existing contractor who is a licensed electrician to train you for a few years, keeping the necessary logbooks to submit for your application to take the electrical licensing examination.</p>
