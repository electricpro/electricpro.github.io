<p>Before applying for a license, electrical contractor companies must designate an employee as the electrician in responsible charge of electrical activities. At the end of the apprenticeship the apprentice is required to pass three examinations, one of which is theory based with the other two practically based. Consider installing a dedicated electrical sub-panel: In addition to the generator and transfer switch, you may want to invest in a dedicated electrical sub-panel, as well.</p>

Damaged, faulty, or outdated electrical outlets. If you're noticing these chronic and small problems, you'll need to schedule a service panel upgrade.</p>

<h3>24 Hour Emergency Electrician Contractor in Clinton IN - Do You Really Need One?</h3>
<p>Perhaps you've rearranged your furniture and realized that you need more lighting in a certain area of a room, or you may need more lights in a naturally dark space like a garage or basement. Surge protectors prevent that from happening. To use a portable generator without the hassle of running extension cords, hire an electrician to install a manual transfer switch subpanel off your main circuit panel and install a dedicated inlet to power the subpanel (installing the subpanel is complex; not a DIY project).</p>
<p>In addition to electric-specific licenses, several states require electrical contractors to obtain a generic contractor license. Backyard ponds benefit from underwater lights , while in-ground well lights provide an elegant, warm glow. If you are looking for a truly unique track lighting system, our Longmont electricians can help design a customized monorail fixture for you. Your lighting system or transformer should be plugged into a GFCI circuit breaker for moisture protection.</p>

Single-phase motors are not likely to be connected to complicated motor control circuitry and will not be discussed in this text. Electricity enters the home through a control panel and a main switch where one can shut off all the power in an emergency.
