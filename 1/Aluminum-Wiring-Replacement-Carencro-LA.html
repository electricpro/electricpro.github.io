<h3>How to Protect Your Restaurant Against Power Surges in Carencro LA</h3>
<p>Remove the top black wire and splice it to two 6" jumper wires. Upgrading an existing panel to 200 amps (which is currently a required minimum standard) costs between $850-1,150. A switch doesn't actually use a neutral wire; it simply takes hot” current from one location and either opens or closes the loop back to the device. Each generator must also be matched to an automatic transfer switch (ATS), which serves as the brains of the standby-power system and tells the generator when to kick on and turn off.</p>
<p>One of the black wires receives power from the service panel; the other sends it on to other loads on the circuit. If you are noticing things like warm outlets or seeing signs of a wiring problem, you may need to quickly turn off your home's electricity. It's also important to note that kitchens should always be wired with ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) outlets to prevent accidental electric shocks. We service both new construction and existing structures needing electrical repair or being remodeled.</p>

Part of the current from the black wire will return through the white wire on the red wire GFCI, causing an imbalance in both GFCI's. This connects to the generator so you can plug in appliances without running (potentially risky) extension cords outdoors. The panel was never designed for this and and for that and several other reasons the local utility usually will not allow it. If they did, then you could add up 200 amps of solar since you would be coming in ahead of the main breaker.</p>
