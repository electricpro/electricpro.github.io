<p>In the most basic of terms, when a home backup generator system senses a power outage it will make the automatic transfer in a matter of seconds to ensure that all electrical circuits are powered normally. From 2003 - 2007, 53% of electrical failure home fires involved other known types of equipment.

<p>Don't worry about having to be there to start and turn off your Generac home backup generator because it does that automatically-whether you're home or away. In this course, you'll get a general overview of the skills and knowledge required of a residential electrician. Don't plug too many cords into an outlet. Let's look at ten electrical safety tips every homeowner should know. While there are no license requirements at the state level in Missouri, many local government offices have their own set of rules.</p>
<p>A Journeyman electrician shall have eight thousand hours experience, which experience may not be obtained in less than three years, registered as an apprentice electrician (of which up to three thousand hours may apply under the qualifications of a class B electrician) under the supervision of a contracting master or master of record licensed electrician in an area where electrical construction work is done in the jurisdiction regulating similar licensing and inspection rules of the state of North Dakota, and successfully completed apprentice electrician training.</p>
<p>Power generator failure can be due to a variety of causes, such as improper installation or lack of maintenance. If your electrical panel has suffered water damage, then it is time to upgrade it. For example, rust is one sign of water damage. If your old 100-amp breaker box goes kaput, Chambers recommends a 100-amp replacement because, for instance, Your stove is gas-fired, your water heater is gas, your heating is gas, and you really only need electricity for air conditioning and lights and 120-volt outlets, so a 100-amp breaker panel is plenty for a house like that," he says.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 26px;"><strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">Call us for immediate assistance in case of any suspected power problems. We're here 24/7.</span></strong></p>
