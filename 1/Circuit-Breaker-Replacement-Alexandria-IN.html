<p>This means that there is a single length of wire running from the transformer to each of the lights in sequence. From bollards to recessed wall lights and all of the necessary hardware, Hinkley offers the ideal contemporary solution to landscape lighting. Those tables provide the maximum power limits for a Class 2 power supply and are far too restrictive to be applied generally to all low voltage lighting installations using a Class 2 power transformer. Another key point is that each master electrician out there started day one on the job not knowing which colored wire nut to use when.</p>
