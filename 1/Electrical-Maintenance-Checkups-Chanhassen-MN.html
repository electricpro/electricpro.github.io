Especially if the new electric panel is physically larger than the one being replaced, the original wires may not reach the circuit breakers in the new panel. Electrical service panels have components inside them that are designed to fail: fuses or circuit breakers.</p>
<p>Tip: If for some reason you cannot finish connecting the switch or outlet and have to complete it at another time, you can place wire nuts over the ends of the unconnected wires and turn the electricity back on until you have the time to finish the job. Consider having a qualified electrician add more circuits or outlets so you do not have to use extension cords. If you find that your circuits trip regularly, your lights flicker infuriatingly often and the need to unplug the fridge to make your hairdryer work is beginning to get on your nerves, it's time to upgrade your panels.</p>
