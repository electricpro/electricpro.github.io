The first exception under 210.70(A) does not stipulate a maximum or minimum number of switched receptacles. Outdoor fixtures like these are made specifically to withstand any type of weather condition included rain, snow, and ice. The Electrical Safety Foundation International (ESFI) reports over 28,000 home fires a year in the U.S. are caused by arc faults.</p>
<p>Two prong receptacles need to be replaced with GFCI outlets and labled with a "No Equipment Ground" sticker that is found in the box with the GFCI receptacle.
