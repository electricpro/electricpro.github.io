<p>Our training courses prepare maintenance personnel to successfully maintain and repair industrial electrical equipment, improve workforce safety and decrease downtime. Solar path lights are a great way to help reduce your energy usage. The Load terminals (red arrows near the top of our photo at left) on an electrical receptacle are for the outgoing wires. Even more impressive is the fact that this type of automated system will automatically switch back to the main electrical power supply when it has been restored.</p>

Similarly, inside box 2, attach the black wire from the three-wire bundle (black, white, copper) to the black terminal on the new switch. Unlike other maintenance and repair tasks that can be quickly fixed, when dealing with electricity it is always best to call a professional. Unfortunately, many Bergen and Hudson County homes still have outdated electrical panels or are in need of replacement for their circuit breakers and electric meters.</p>
