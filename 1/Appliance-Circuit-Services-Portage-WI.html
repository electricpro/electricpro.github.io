<p>Spotlighting: We typically highlight one or two of your property's focal points using spotlighting.

A good flow of information between the customer and the electrical contractor is critical to keep a construction job on schedule and budget. If you experience blown fuses, flickering lights, or simply have an old breaker in need of service, it's time to let a professional take a look.</p>
<p>Personalized Service: Our technicians will inspect your home and determine the correct generator needed to power all your appliances and systems.

<p>Electrical outlets are marked according to its operation including electrical outlets for the residence, commercial and industrial industry. Building power usage and loads need to be surveyed to ensure the generator is producing the correct wattage to meet all electrical power requirements. Then, before you cut out a wall outlet opening in existing drywall , place an old-work box (also known as a remodeling box) backwards on the drywall so that the centerline of the box aligns with the mark you made on the wall.</p>
<p>The other outlets are similarly wired. Portable and permanent generators come in varying sizes and types. Candidates must show proof of working as an electrician and having completed an apprenticeship program. Home generators provide worry-free emergency power to support your electrical needs for days, or even weeks. If you have ungrounded two prong copper wiring throughout the house, you should have your house rewired so you can have the added safety of a ground conductor in your home's electrical wiring system.</p>
<p>If you have a fixture not working dont hesitate to call Empire Electric 904-365-7777 for any Lighting Services you may ever require.
