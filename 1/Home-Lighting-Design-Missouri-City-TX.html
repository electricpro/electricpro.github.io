Warranties on fixtures and transformers range from one to 10 years, but fixtures made of brass, copper, or stainless steel should shine indefinitely. With residential standby power systems, there are a variety of output sizes from 12 kW and higher. Pioneer Electric has lightning arresters on our primary electric lines and we ensure that our system is properly grounded.</p>
<p>Turn the breaker on to test the outlet and, if it works, turn the breaker off and secure the outlet back into the wall. No, not having a ground on the switch won't make the outlet fail to work. Power surges can be caused by lightning strikes or fluctuations in the electrical grid.
