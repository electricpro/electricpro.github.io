Not Using A Voltmeter - While the introduction of LED landscape lighting has diminished the need for a voltmeter (because of the wider range of acceptable voltage), having this tool on hand is essential for systems of greater than 10 lights or for systems with wire runs longer than 100 ft. And, is a must-have tool for troubleshooting a system. Solar outdoor lighting systems charge their batteries during the day and produce a low voltage light during the night time hours.</p>
