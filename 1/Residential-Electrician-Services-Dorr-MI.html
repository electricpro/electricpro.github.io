Unlike whole-house generators, you have to manually add fuel to your portable generator before each use. Here in Lake and Porter Counties, where the threat of power outages is year-round, a whole-house generator can prove to be a good investment for your home or commercial property in Crown Point or the surrounding areas.</p>
<p>Turn the breaker on to test the outlet and, if it works, turn the breaker off and secure the outlet back into the wall. No, not having a ground on the switch won't make the outlet fail to work.

For example, rust is one sign of water damage. If your old 100-amp breaker box goes kaput, Chambers recommends a 100-amp replacement because, for instance, Your stove is gas-fired, your water heater is gas, your heating is gas, and you really only need electricity for air conditioning and lights and 120-volt outlets, so a 100-amp breaker panel is plenty for a house like that," he says.</p>
